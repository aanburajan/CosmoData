       "  u'\"Santa Baby\" was originally recorded by Eartha Kitt with Henri Ren\\xe9 and his orchestra in New York City on October 6, 1953. It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-5502 (in the USA),  and by EMI on the His Master\\'s Voice label as catalog number B 10728. The song was a huge hit for Kitt, and she later said that it was one of her favorite songs to record; she reprised it in the 1954 film New Faces. Kitt also reprised the original song in a 1963 re-recording for Kapp Records, with a more uptempo arrangement. (Madonna\\'s popular rendition for the 1987 charity album A Very Special Christmas is based on this latter version.) In 1954, Eartha Kitt recorded a new version of the song with new lyrics titled \"This Year\\'s Santa Baby\", to no commercial success. Writers listed did not change. The song was featured in the 1989 film Driving Miss Daisy.',\n",

       "  u'\"It\\'s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas\" is a classic Christmas song written in 1951 by Meredith Willson. The song was originally titled \"It\\'s Beginning to Look Like Christmas\". The song has been recorded by many artists, but was a hit by Perry Como and The Fontane Sisters with Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra on September 10, 1951. A popular but unproven belief in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, holds that Willson wrote the song while staying in Yarmouth\\'s Grand Hotel. The song makes reference to a \"tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well...\"; the park being Frost Park, directly across the road from the Grand Hotel which still operates in Yarmouth. However Grand Hotel was a popular name used by many hotels in numerous towns and cities.\\n\\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas \\nEv\\'rywhere you go; \\nTake a look in the five-and-ten, glistening once again \\nWith candy canes and silver lanes aglow. \\n\\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas, \\nToys in ev\\'ry store, \\nBut the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be\\n On your own front door. \\n\\nA pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots \\nIs the wish of Barney and Ben; \\nDolls that will talk and will go for a walk \\nIs the hope of Janice and Jen; \\nAnd Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.\\n \\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas\\n Ev\\'rywhere you go;\\n There\\'s a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,\\n The sturdy kind that doesn\\'t mind the snow.\\n \\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas;\\n Soon the bells will start,\\n And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing\\n Right within your heart.',\n",

       "  u\"I flew to London England in September. While there, I took a day trip to Scotland to see the countryside of England and Scotland. The countryside of England reminded me of the countryside of Ohio and Michigan. It was interesting to people watch, noticing the very subtle difference in facial features as compared with the average American mutt. Here in America, we have so many cultures, ethnicities  from many European and non european nations as well as the native Americans, who have over the last 2 or 3 hundred years integrated to various degrees in different parts of this country. Its rare here that an individual doesn't have 2, 3 or 4 different nationalities. In England, I had a great time talking to people at bus and subway stations, coffee houses and even at the grocery store inquiring about their background and a bit of the local history. Most of the people there are completely English, scottish or Irish - or at least the ones I talked too. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis footage was taken on my 33rd birthday 9-15-2009. I was surprised though to find graffiti in small cities in England and even Scotland. I guess subconsciously i associated graffiti with American culture.\\r\\nSince I only stayed till sunset, I walked all around Edinburgh taking pictures and video and getting lost.\\r\\nAs the sun began to lower in the clear Scottish skies, it was time to head back to Waverly station.\\r\\nIt was a beautiful day and after boarding back on the train, a beautiful sunset.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the way back I spoke the whole time to this English woman named Fionna, who bought be tea and biscuits after I mentioned it was my birthday. We talked the whole time and it was nice in that moment to really chat in depth with some one on the other side of the world whom I'd never see again. \\r\\n\\r\\nI arrived back in London just after midnight and in light rain with out an umbrella. When I stood up to exit the train, I almost fell over because of the sever pain in my feet from walking all over Edinburg from 11:00 am till 7:00 pm. The next day back in London, I stayed in to rest my feet.\",\n",

       "  u\"Travel video about destination London in England.\\nLondon is an exciting and pulsating metropolis of the new millennium, a melting pot of both people and culture and a fascinating city of diverse contrasts.\\n\\nThe City Of London contains the Tower, an historic landmark with a remarkable history. A mighty medieval fortress with 13 towers that throughout its 900 years, has served many functions and from the Middle Ages, it was a heavily fortified prison.\\n\\nAfter the medieval St. Paul's Cathedral was destroyed by a devastating fire in 1666, Christopher Wren was ordered to re-build it with a dome. During the 36 years of its construction, its design was frequently altered until finally a wonderful masterpiece of church architecture was created.\\n\\nThe Monument is the city's tallest freestanding stone column and a reminder of the Great Fire of London that destroyed 80 percent of the city. In four days, more than 13,000 buildings were destroyed and the Monument was built on the site of the bakery in which the fire began.\\n\\nSince the reign of Queen Victoria, Buckingham Palace has served as London's royal residence. A garden of mulberry trees once grew on the site of today's palace and the Duke of Buckingham subsequently added a simple brick built residence. Around 60 years later, George II purchased the site for his wife and George IV eventually began to design an extensive palace complex.\\n\\nThe highlight of any holiday in London must be the largest Ferris wheel in the world, the London Eye. Situated on the banks of the Thames, it rises high into the sky, opposite the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben.\\n\\nThe former centre of the largest empire in the world, London is still a city of superlatives that attracts millions of visitors each year. Exciting both day and night, London is a modern city with age old traditions and a long and colorful history.\\n\\n--------------\\nWatch more travel videos \\u25ba http://goo.gl/HYQdhg\\nJoin us.

       "  u\"9 Things You Didn't Know About AHS \\u25ba\\u25ba http://youtu.be/yzzU6sGxatM\\nMore Celebrity News \\u25ba\\u25ba http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews\\n\\nThe Freak Show has FINALLY arrived, and if the season premiere is any indication, we\\u2019re in for one WILD ride. Yes, American Horror Story: Freak Show debuted on FX last night and it was just as creepy \\u2013 if not creepier \\u2013 than you\\u2019d imagine it to be.\\nAnd since it was a super-sized 90 minute episode, we\\u2019re going to break down five of the downright scariest moments just for you guys. And obviously, a recap means there\\u2019s going to be some spoilers, so if you\\u2019ve yet to tune in yet \\u2013 maybe you\\u2019re just waiting to watch it when it\\u2019s light outside, no judgment \\u2013 hit pause and check out this video instead \\u2013 it\\u2019s basically the ultimate preview. (CLICK THROUGH TO ANOTHER VIDEO BOX)\\nAlright, let\\u2019s get started!\\nFirst up, let\\u2019s talk about the conjoined twins Bette and Dot and the fact that, oh ya know, BETTE KILLED THEIR MOTHER! \\n\\nWhich is totally crazy because we got the vibe that Bette was the sweeter one. This just shows, you gotta watch out for the nice ones! But yes, Bette kills their mother not only because she basically locked them away for most of their lives, but Bette wants to be a STAR \\u2013 and will get rid of anyone who gets in the way of her dream.  \\nThe second moment that made all the hairs on the back of our neck stand up? Our first intro to Twisty the clown. Two kids were getting frisky by the lake when ol\\u2019 Twisty showed up to haunt all of our dreams forever. It seemed innocent enough at first but then\\u2026\\n\\nWe guess they call him a killer clown for a reason.\\nNext, there was a freaking carnie sex tape. Yes, Jessica Lange\\u2019s character became friendly with a hospital worker, from where she found Bette and Dot, and brought her along to the freak show. And well, things got FREAKY \\u2013 in more ways than one. We\\u2019re going to try to keep things PG here, but we think her reaction shot says it all.\\n\\nAnd because what AHS episode would be complete without someone dying, the next moment on our list is when Jimmy killed a cop who came looking for Bette and Dot.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s one way to keep the family together.\\nAnd last but certainly not least, this moment is really creepy, but it was definitely a highlight. Elsa Mars takes the stage to sing David Bowie\\u2019s \\u201cLife on Mars\\u201d and not only did we get to see the freak show in action, the whole thing was just AWESOME.\\n\\nOh, and a bonus highlight? We got to see that the woman in charge was a \\u201cfreak\\u201d herself as she had a private moment when she revealed that she is missing her legs.\\n\\nOh, and a bonus highlight?

Quer ir ou n\\xe3o? E..... pelo visto, vou te inserir na minha paisagem, e voc\\xea vai me ensinar as suas verdades, e se pensar, a gente j\\xe1 queria tudo isso no inicio..... De dia, vou me mostrar de longe. De noite, voc\\xea ver\\xe1 de perto. O certo e o incerto, a gente vai saber. E mesmo assim, queria te contar que eu tenho aqui comigo alguma coisa pra te dar. Tem espa\\xe7o de sobra no meu cora\\xe7\\xe3o. Eu vou te levar em um lugar que nunca foi antes.......\" by joel\\n\\n\\n\" Like two strangers , to each his own road , we came across a corner , in a common place . Hey What are your plans ? Until I have several . If you follow me , the way I can tell you. Yet , I wanted to ask you if you but you have to give me something , you have plenty of room in your heart . whether you go or not ? ..... and apparently , I\\'ll put you in my landscape, and you will teach me the its truths , and to think , we have wanted all this in the beginning ..... by day , I\\'ll show myself out . at night , you\\'ll see up close. certain and uncertain , we will know . even just wanted to tell you that I have here with me to give you something . has plenty of room in my heart . gonna take you somewhere that was never before ....... \" by joel\\n',\n",

We loved it. It combined two of the things we are working to accomplish -- inviting people to classical music and inspiring young musicians. Steven Sharp Nelson had soloed with the orchestra the previous year and loved the spirit and the talent that the orchestra showed at such young ages (ages 13-18!) Together we developed the concept of \"Beethoven\\'s 5 Secrets,\" combining OneRepublic\\'s tune \"Secrets\" with melodies and moments from all four movements of Beethoven\\'s 5th Symphony.\\n\\nWe used 5 different melodies from the 4 movements of Beethoven\\'s 5th Symphony (not including the \"bridge\" the orchestra plays in the middle). Try to guess where they are and where they come from!\\n\\nWhat are Beethoven\\'s secrets? He had many. His most prominent secret that he desperately tried to keep from the public and that caused him to be considered extremely eccentric, irritable, and hermit-like was his \"weakness.\" He was deaf during most of his life. Imagine that...one of the greatest composers that ever lived could hardly hear. And yet, he wrote his life\\'s greatest works after becoming deaf. He believed that art itself had \"secrets\" that had to be \"forced into\" in order to obtain art\\'s highest level. There is no doubt Beethoven discovered many of the \"secrets\" of art -- people all over the world enjoy them every day. He was a true master of music, blessed by God. This piece and video are dedicated to him.\\n\\n\\nFilming locations:\\nThe Mountains of St. George Utah\\nAmerican Heritage School\\nTPG Studios\\nMetCom Studio (Behind the Scenes footage)\\n\\nCredits\\n\\nArrangement written and produced by Al van der Beek & Steven Sharp Nelson\\nOrchestrated by Kayson Brown & Steven Sharp Nelson\\nPerformed by\\nAmerican Heritage Lyceum Philharmonic, under the direction of Kayson Brown\\nAdditional violin work by Julie Ann Nelson (Steven\\'s wife!) & Matthew John Nelson (Steven\\'s brother!)\\nSteven Sharp Nelson: Acoustic cello, electric cellos, percussion, vocal textures\\nAl van der Beek: Vocal textures, percussion\\nSecrets originally written by Ryan Tedder, published by SONY/ATV TUNES LLC \\nSymphony No. 5 in C Minor, Opus 67 written by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1804-1808 and debuted in Vienna\\'s Theater an der Wien in 1808\\nOrchestra recorded at MetCom Studios (http://www.metcomstudios.com) \\nAll other instruments recorded by Al van der Beek at TPG Studios\\nMixed and Mastered by Al van der Beek at TPG Studio\\nVideo produced by Paul Anderson & Tel Stewart\\n\\nDedicated to Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827)',\n",

Now you\\'re invited to hear astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, comic co-host Eugene Mirman and guest futurists Jason Silva and Melissa Sterry answer questions that lie at the intersection of technology, human biology and urban planning. Will bio-ware and nanotechnology allow humans to reprogram our biology? Can smart-materials, adaptive structures and sensor nets help city planners and policy makers create smart cities that adapt to environmental change the way forests do? Are we really approaching a \"technological singularity\" of emerging super-intelligence beyond which events cannot be predicted -- and has humanity actually experienced one before?\\n\\nCo-Host:\\nEugene Mirman, comedian\\n\\nGuests:\\nJason Silva, futurist\\nMelissa Sterry, futurist',\n",

Joseph Campbell said, \"Follow your bliss.\"  I couldn\\'t agree more with that.  My mom always said, \"Just do what you love and don\\'t worry about anything else, don\\'t worry about money, don\\'t worry about anything.  Just be kind to everyone and do what you love.\"\\r\\nAs long as you\\'re not hurting anybody else, as long as you\\'re being kind to people and you\\'re doing what you love, only good things can come of it.  Other good advices are people who claim to have absolute irrefutable faith in something without any evidence, I would not trust completely.  Yeah, I just, I\\'m a, I relate a lot to people like Carl Sagan.  I recently read one of his books that was based on a speech that he gave in a divinity school.  It\\'s interesting because Carl Sagan was one hundred percent a scientist but he was very spiritual.  I mean and he said, \"The universe gives up plenty to be spiritual about, we don\\'t need to adapt any form of dogma.\"\\r\\nLook at the evidence and to be willing to question your own truths, and to be willing to scrutinize things that you hold dearly because that way, that transparency, that self awareness will protect you from ever becoming somebody that whose beliefs somehow make them have myopic vision about what could be. So, remain open and be willing to be transformed by new information.\\r\\nRecorded on: April 14, 2009\\n\\nQuestion: What\\'s the best advice you\\'ve ever gotten?\\r\\nJason Silva: I always say that one of the best pieces of advice that I\\'ve ever gotten, has been echoed by two great thinkers, my mother Linda Mishkin and Joseph Campbell.

She is currently working on turning The Human Project into a global campaign to get the Connected generation to think seriously about the future of our species. She is also launching road:infinity, an innovation strategy firm focused on growing a new generation of radical entrepreneurs who have the nerve to pursue visions of cosmic proportions. \\n\\nBefore embarking on her current mission, Ilves served as an executive at the iconic Norwegian technology company TANDBERG (acquired by Cicso in 2010) and spent 6 years as a consultant with McKinsey & Company where she co-led the Firm\\'s South-East Asian banking practice and managed large-scale performance transformations for banks in Asia-Pacific, Africa and Europe.

Why don\\'t they just ask that question?  Because they want to see where you will go with an open-ended question.  Your answer tells the interviewer where your mind is.

See if you\\'re a genius or an imbecile!\\n\\nSubscribe to Thomas8april - on this channel I upload videos of which will interest/amaze you from quirky tests to clever brain tricks such as \"I can guess your birthday\". Subscribe now: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=thomas8april\\n\\nFollow me on twitter: https://twitter.com/Thomas8april\\n\\n***ANSWERS EXPLAINED***\\n\\n1. In Question One, if Johnny\\'s MOTHER has THREE children:\\n\\n- April\\n- May\\n- ???\\n\\nThen obviously, as it is Johnny\\'s mother, Johnny is the third child, as she is his mother, hence her child.\\n\\n2. He is a BUTCHER, therefore he weighs MEAT, as it is his job.\\n\\n3. Mount Everest has always been the highest mountain, just no-one knew of it.\\n\\n4. There is obviously no dirt in a hole - it would just fall right through, right?\\n\\n5. The word \\'incorrectly\\' is the only word which is spelt I-N-C-O-R-R-E-C-T-L-Y\\n\\n6. In the Southern Hemisphere (i.e Australia), they have summer during our winter, and winter during our summer. Therefore, 26th December is summer in the Southern Hemisphere. That is how Billies birthday falls in summer.\\n\\n7. You cannot take a picture with a wooden leg, it doesn\\'t even have a lens?! You have to take a picture of a man with a camera, or a camera phone, etc.\\n\\n8. You would be in second place of course, if you pass the person in 2nd place, you are now 2nd and that person you overtook is now 3rd. If you overtook the person in 1st, you will be 1st.\\n\\n9. Neither of these terms are correct. Egg yolks are never white. Egg yolks are always yellow.\\n\\n10. If you combine haystacks isn\\'t it just one massive haystack?!\\n\\nThank you for watching, please subscribe.\\n~ Thomas8april',\n",

       "  u'\"The New Disney Blockbuster\" (AP) [Aladdin] has arrived on Broadway, and audiences and critics agree: this show\\'s a hit! \\n\\nThe producers of The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast and Newsies have brought the beloved story of Aladdin to thrilling theatrical life in this bold new musical comedy that The Huffington Post calls, \"One of the most delirious things of its kind in years!\" Filled with daring adventure, classic comedy and timeless romance, ALADDIN is \"fabulous\" and \"extravagant,\" says The New York Times. \\n\\nALADDIN features all your favorite songs from the film as well as new music written by Tony and Academy Award winner Alan Menken (Newsies) with lyrics penned by the legendary Howard Ashman (Beauty and the Beast), and Tony Award winner Tim Rice (The Lion King, Aida). Hailed by Newsday as \"an awesome throwback to old-time musical comedy,\" it is directed and choreographed by Tony Award winner Casey Nicholaw (The Book of Mormon), with book and additional lyrics by Chad Beguelin (The Wedding Singer). ALADDIN  also boasts an incomparable design team, with sets, costumes and lighting from Tony Award winners Bob Crowley (Mary Poppins), Greg Barned (The Drowsy Chaperone), and Natasha Katz (Once). \\n\\nWith exhilarating choreography, show-stopping performances and astonishing visual effects, ALADDIN is, as NBC-TV declares, \"Exactly what you wished for!\"',\n",

Extreme, exotic, and mostly undiscovered, home to nomads, ringers, eagle hunters and horsemen. A land of adventure!Ulaanbaatar is the capital of Mongolia and is a metropolis set amid the steppes, truly the pulsating heart of the country that combines the cultures of old with a lively feeling of moving towards new horizons. Ganden Hyid is a pilgrimage destination for the faithful from all over Mongolia. They pray and wind prayer mills and crowd into the main sanctuary. In the monastery\\u2019s main temple is a twenty six metre high statue of the Buddha Of Mercy, patron saint of Mongolia that is decorated with gold and gems. Almost fifty kilometres east of Ulaanbaatar is a leisure area for the inhabitants of the city, the Terej National Park. Here horse riding is available across country and without limit, a fact that pleases the basic instincts of the Mongolian heart. In Kharkhorin, former residence of those who once ruled Mongolia, today there is little left to see. However, a few mysterious sites remain which, along with the Erdene Zuu Monastery, are highly evocative of this ancient city in Central Mongolia as for thirty two years it was the centre of one of the most powerful empires on Earth. The Magic of Mongolia can be felt by all who come here and this journey across a harsh and contrasting land has been an unforgettable adventure beyond compare.',\n",

       "  u'\"Santa Baby\" was originally recorded by Eartha Kitt with Henri Ren\\xe9 and his orchestra in New York City on October 6, 1953. It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-5502 (in the USA),  and by EMI on the His Master\\'s Voice label as catalog number B 10728. The song was a huge hit for Kitt, and she later said that it was one of her favorite songs to record; she reprised it in the 1954 film New Faces. Kitt also reprised the original song in a 1963 re-recording for Kapp Records, with a more uptempo arrangement. (Madonna\\'s popular rendition for the 1987 charity album A Very Special Christmas is based on this latter version.) In 1954, Eartha Kitt recorded a new version of the song with new lyrics titled \"This Year\\'s Santa Baby\", to no commercial success. Writers listed did not change. The song was featured in the 1989 film Driving Miss Daisy.',\n",

       "  u'\"It\\'s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas\" is a classic Christmas song written in 1951 by Meredith Willson. The song was originally titled \"It\\'s Beginning to Look Like Christmas\". The song has been recorded by many artists, but was a hit by Perry Como and The Fontane Sisters with Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra on September 10, 1951. A popular but unproven belief in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, holds that Willson wrote the song while staying in Yarmouth\\'s Grand Hotel. The song makes reference to a \"tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well...\"; the park being Frost Park, directly across the road from the Grand Hotel which still operates in Yarmouth. However Grand Hotel was a popular name used by many hotels in numerous towns and cities.\\n\\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas \\nEv\\'rywhere you go; \\nTake a look in the five-and-ten, glistening once again \\nWith candy canes and silver lanes aglow. \\n\\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas, \\nToys in ev\\'ry store, \\nBut the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be\\n On your own front door. \\n\\nA pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots \\nIs the wish of Barney and Ben; \\nDolls that will talk and will go for a walk \\nIs the hope of Janice and Jen; \\nAnd Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.\\n \\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas\\n Ev\\'rywhere you go;\\n There\\'s a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,\\n The sturdy kind that doesn\\'t mind the snow.\\n \\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas;\\n Soon the bells will start,\\n And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing\\n Right within your heart.',\n",

       "  u'Train Ride from London England to Edinburgh Scotland 9-15-2009 in HD',\n",
       "  u\"I flew to London England in September. While there, I took a day trip to Scotland to see the countryside of England and Scotland. The countryside of England reminded me of the countryside of Ohio and Michigan. It was interesting to people watch, noticing the very subtle difference in facial features as compared with the average American mutt. Here in America, we have so many cultures, ethnicities  from many European and non european nations as well as the native Americans, who have over the last 2 or 3 hundred years integrated to various degrees in different parts of this country. Its rare here that an individual doesn't have 2, 3 or 4 different nationalities. In England, I had a great time talking to people at bus and subway stations, coffee houses and even at the grocery store inquiring about their background and a bit of the local history. Most of the people there are completely English, scottish or Irish - or at least the ones I talked too. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis footage was taken on my 33rd birthday 9-15-2009. I was surprised though to find graffiti in small cities in England and even Scotland. I guess subconsciously i associated graffiti with American culture.\\r\\nSince I only stayed till sunset, I walked all around Edinburgh taking pictures and video and getting lost.\\r\\nAs the sun began to lower in the clear Scottish skies, it was time to head back to Waverly station.\\r\\nIt was a beautiful day and after boarding back on the train, a beautiful sunset.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the way back I spoke the whole time to this English woman named Fionna, who bought be tea and biscuits after I mentioned it was my birthday. We talked the whole time and it was nice in that moment to really chat in depth with some one on the other side of the world whom I'd never see again. \\r\\n\\r\\nI arrived back in London just after midnight and in light rain with out an umbrella. When I stood up to exit the train, I almost fell over because of the sever pain in my feet from walking all over Edinburg from 11:00 am till 7:00 pm. The next day back in London, I stayed in to rest my feet.\",\n",

       "  u\"Travel video about destination London in England.\\nLondon is an exciting and pulsating metropolis of the new millennium, a melting pot of both people and culture and a fascinating city of diverse contrasts.\\n\\nThe City Of London contains the Tower, an historic landmark with a remarkable history. A mighty medieval fortress with 13 towers that throughout its 900 years, has served many functions and from the Middle Ages, it was a heavily fortified prison.\\n\\nAfter the medieval St. Paul's Cathedral was destroyed by a devastating fire in 1666, Christopher Wren was ordered to re-build it with a dome. During the 36 years of its construction, its design was frequently altered until finally a wonderful masterpiece of church architecture was created.\\n\\nThe Monument is the city's tallest freestanding stone column and a reminder of the Great Fire of London that destroyed 80 percent of the city. In four days, more than 13,000 buildings were destroyed and the Monument was built on the site of the bakery in which the fire began.\\n\\nSince the reign of Queen Victoria, Buckingham Palace has served as London's royal residence. A garden of mulberry trees once grew on the site of today's palace and the Duke of Buckingham subsequently added a simple brick built residence. Around 60 years later, George II purchased the site for his wife and George IV eventually began to design an extensive palace complex.\\n\\nThe highlight of any holiday in London must be the largest Ferris wheel in the world, the London Eye. Situated on the banks of the Thames, it rises high into the sky, opposite the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben.\\n\\nThe former centre of the largest empire in the world, London is still a city of superlatives that attracts millions of visitors each year. Exciting both day and night, London is a modern city with age old traditions and a long and colorful history.\\n\\n--------------\\nWatch more travel videos \\u25ba http://goo.gl/HYQdhg\\nJoin us.

       "  u'\"Santa Baby\" was originally recorded by Eartha Kitt with Henri Ren\\xe9 and his orchestra in New York City on October 6, 1953. It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-5502 (in the USA),  and by EMI on the His Master\\'s Voice label as catalog number B 10728. The song was a huge hit for Kitt, and she later said that it was one of her favorite songs to record; she reprised it in the 1954 film New Faces. Kitt also reprised the original song in a 1963 re-recording for Kapp Records, with a more uptempo arrangement. (Madonna\\'s popular rendition for the 1987 charity album A Very Special Christmas is based on this latter version.) In 1954, Eartha Kitt recorded a new version of the song with new lyrics titled \"This Year\\'s Santa Baby\", to no commercial success. Writers listed did not change. The song was featured in the 1989 film Driving Miss Daisy.',\n",

       "  u'\"It\\'s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas\" is a classic Christmas song written in 1951 by Meredith Willson. The song was originally titled \"It\\'s Beginning to Look Like Christmas\". The song has been recorded by many artists, but was a hit by Perry Como and The Fontane Sisters with Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra on September 10, 1951. A popular but unproven belief in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, holds that Willson wrote the song while staying in Yarmouth\\'s Grand Hotel. The song makes reference to a \"tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well...\"; the park being Frost Park, directly across the road from the Grand Hotel which still operates in Yarmouth. However Grand Hotel was a popular name used by many hotels in numerous towns and cities.\\n\\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas \\nEv\\'rywhere you go; \\nTake a look in the five-and-ten, glistening once again \\nWith candy canes and silver lanes aglow. \\n\\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas, \\nToys in ev\\'ry store, \\nBut the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be\\n On your own front door. \\n\\nA pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots \\nIs the wish of Barney and Ben; \\nDolls that will talk and will go for a walk \\nIs the hope of Janice and Jen; \\nAnd Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.\\n \\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas\\n Ev\\'rywhere you go;\\n There\\'s a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,\\n The sturdy kind that doesn\\'t mind the snow.\\n \\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas;\\n Soon the bells will start,\\n And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing\\n Right within your heart.',\n",

       "  u\"I flew to London England in September. While there, I took a day trip to Scotland to see the countryside of England and Scotland. The countryside of England reminded me of the countryside of Ohio and Michigan. It was interesting to people watch, noticing the very subtle difference in facial features as compared with the average American mutt. Here in America, we have so many cultures, ethnicities  from many European and non european nations as well as the native Americans, who have over the last 2 or 3 hundred years integrated to various degrees in different parts of this country. Its rare here that an individual doesn't have 2, 3 or 4 different nationalities. In England, I had a great time talking to people at bus and subway stations, coffee houses and even at the grocery store inquiring about their background and a bit of the local history. Most of the people there are completely English, scottish or Irish - or at least the ones I talked too. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis footage was taken on my 33rd birthday 9-15-2009. I was surprised though to find graffiti in small cities in England and even Scotland. I guess subconsciously i associated graffiti with American culture.\\r\\nSince I only stayed till sunset, I walked all around Edinburgh taking pictures and video and getting lost.\\r\\nAs the sun began to lower in the clear Scottish skies, it was time to head back to Waverly station.\\r\\nIt was a beautiful day and after boarding back on the train, a beautiful sunset.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the way back I spoke the whole time to this English woman named Fionna, who bought be tea and biscuits after I mentioned it was my birthday. We talked the whole time and it was nice in that moment to really chat in depth with some one on the other side of the world whom I'd never see again. \\r\\n\\r\\nI arrived back in London just after midnight and in light rain with out an umbrella. When I stood up to exit the train, I almost fell over because of the sever pain in my feet from walking all over Edinburg from 11:00 am till 7:00 pm. The next day back in London, I stayed in to rest my feet.\",\n",

       "  u\"Travel video about destination London in England.\\nLondon is an exciting and pulsating metropolis of the new millennium, a melting pot of both people and culture and a fascinating city of diverse contrasts.\\n\\nThe City Of London contains the Tower, an historic landmark with a remarkable history. A mighty medieval fortress with 13 towers that throughout its 900 years, has served many functions and from the Middle Ages, it was a heavily fortified prison.\\n\\nAfter the medieval St. Paul's Cathedral was destroyed by a devastating fire in 1666, Christopher Wren was ordered to re-build it with a dome. During the 36 years of its construction, its design was frequently altered until finally a wonderful masterpiece of church architecture was created.\\n\\nThe Monument is the city's tallest freestanding stone column and a reminder of the Great Fire of London that destroyed 80 percent of the city. In four days, more than 13,000 buildings were destroyed and the Monument was built on the site of the bakery in which the fire began.\\n\\nSince the reign of Queen Victoria, Buckingham Palace has served as London's royal residence. A garden of mulberry trees once grew on the site of today's palace and the Duke of Buckingham subsequently added a simple brick built residence. Around 60 years later, George II purchased the site for his wife and George IV eventually began to design an extensive palace complex.\\n\\nThe highlight of any holiday in London must be the largest Ferris wheel in the world, the London Eye. Situated on the banks of the Thames, it rises high into the sky, opposite the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben.\\n\\nThe former centre of the largest empire in the world, London is still a city of superlatives that attracts millions of visitors each year. Exciting both day and night, London is a modern city with age old traditions and a long and colorful history.\\n\\n--------------\\nWatch more travel videos \\u25ba http://goo.gl/HYQdhg\\nJoin us.

       "  u'\"Santa Baby\" was originally recorded by Eartha Kitt with Henri Ren\\xe9 and his orchestra in New York City on October 6, 1953. It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-5502 (in the USA),  and by EMI on the His Master\\'s Voice label as catalog number B 10728. The song was a huge hit for Kitt, and she later said that it was one of her favorite songs to record; she reprised it in the 1954 film New Faces. Kitt also reprised the original song in a 1963 re-recording for Kapp Records, with a more uptempo arrangement. (Madonna\\'s popular rendition for the 1987 charity album A Very Special Christmas is based on this latter version.) In 1954, Eartha Kitt recorded a new version of the song with new lyrics titled \"This Year\\'s Santa Baby\", to no commercial success. Writers listed did not change. The song was featured in the 1989 film Driving Miss Daisy.',\n",

       "  u'\"It\\'s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas\" is a classic Christmas song written in 1951 by Meredith Willson. The song was originally titled \"It\\'s Beginning to Look Like Christmas\". The song has been recorded by many artists, but was a hit by Perry Como and The Fontane Sisters with Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra on September 10, 1951. A popular but unproven belief in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, holds that Willson wrote the song while staying in Yarmouth\\'s Grand Hotel. The song makes reference to a \"tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well...\"; the park being Frost Park, directly across the road from the Grand Hotel which still operates in Yarmouth. However Grand Hotel was a popular name used by many hotels in numerous towns and cities.\\n\\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas \\nEv\\'rywhere you go; \\nTake a look in the five-and-ten, glistening once again \\nWith candy canes and silver lanes aglow. \\n\\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas, \\nToys in ev\\'ry store, \\nBut the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be\\n On your own front door. \\n\\nA pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots \\nIs the wish of Barney and Ben; \\nDolls that will talk and will go for a walk \\nIs the hope of Janice and Jen; \\nAnd Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.\\n \\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas\\n Ev\\'rywhere you go;\\n There\\'s a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,\\n The sturdy kind that doesn\\'t mind the snow.\\n \\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas;\\n Soon the bells will start,\\n And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing\\n Right within your heart.',\n",

       "  u\"I flew to London England in September. While there, I took a day trip to Scotland to see the countryside of England and Scotland. The countryside of England reminded me of the countryside of Ohio and Michigan. It was interesting to people watch, noticing the very subtle difference in facial features as compared with the average American mutt. Here in America, we have so many cultures, ethnicities  from many European and non european nations as well as the native Americans, who have over the last 2 or 3 hundred years integrated to various degrees in different parts of this country. Its rare here that an individual doesn't have 2, 3 or 4 different nationalities. In England, I had a great time talking to people at bus and subway stations, coffee houses and even at the grocery store inquiring about their background and a bit of the local history. Most of the people there are completely English, scottish or Irish - or at least the ones I talked too. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis footage was taken on my 33rd birthday 9-15-2009. I was surprised though to find graffiti in small cities in England and even Scotland. I guess subconsciously i associated graffiti with American culture.\\r\\nSince I only stayed till sunset, I walked all around Edinburgh taking pictures and video and getting lost.\\r\\nAs the sun began to lower in the clear Scottish skies, it was time to head back to Waverly station.\\r\\nIt was a beautiful day and after boarding back on the train, a beautiful sunset.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the way back I spoke the whole time to this English woman named Fionna, who bought be tea and biscuits after I mentioned it was my birthday. We talked the whole time and it was nice in that moment to really chat in depth with some one on the other side of the world whom I'd never see again. \\r\\n\\r\\nI arrived back in London just after midnight and in light rain with out an umbrella. When I stood up to exit the train, I almost fell over because of the sever pain in my feet from walking all over Edinburg from 11:00 am till 7:00 pm. The next day back in London, I stayed in to rest my feet.\",\n",

       "  u\"Travel video about destination London in England.\\nLondon is an exciting and pulsating metropolis of the new millennium, a melting pot of both people and culture and a fascinating city of diverse contrasts.\\n\\nThe City Of London contains the Tower, an historic landmark with a remarkable history. A mighty medieval fortress with 13 towers that throughout its 900 years, has served many functions and from the Middle Ages, it was a heavily fortified prison.\\n\\nAfter the medieval St. Paul's Cathedral was destroyed by a devastating fire in 1666, Christopher Wren was ordered to re-build it with a dome. During the 36 years of its construction, its design was frequently altered until finally a wonderful masterpiece of church architecture was created.\\n\\nThe Monument is the city's tallest freestanding stone column and a reminder of the Great Fire of London that destroyed 80 percent of the city. In four days, more than 13,000 buildings were destroyed and the Monument was built on the site of the bakery in which the fire began.\\n\\nSince the reign of Queen Victoria, Buckingham Palace has served as London's royal residence. A garden of mulberry trees once grew on the site of today's palace and the Duke of Buckingham subsequently added a simple brick built residence. Around 60 years later, George II purchased the site for his wife and George IV eventually began to design an extensive palace complex.\\n\\nThe highlight of any holiday in London must be the largest Ferris wheel in the world, the London Eye. Situated on the banks of the Thames, it rises high into the sky, opposite the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben.\\n\\nThe former centre of the largest empire in the world, London is still a city of superlatives that attracts millions of visitors each year. Exciting both day and night, London is a modern city with age old traditions and a long and colorful history.\\n\\n--------------\\nWatch more travel videos \\u25ba http://goo.gl/HYQdhg\\nJoin us.

       "  u'\"Santa Baby\" was originally recorded by Eartha Kitt with Henri Ren\\xe9 and his orchestra in New York City on October 6, 1953. It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-5502 (in the USA),  and by EMI on the His Master\\'s Voice label as catalog number B 10728. The song was a huge hit for Kitt, and she later said that it was one of her favorite songs to record; she reprised it in the 1954 film New Faces. Kitt also reprised the original song in a 1963 re-recording for Kapp Records, with a more uptempo arrangement. (Madonna\\'s popular rendition for the 1987 charity album A Very Special Christmas is based on this latter version.) In 1954, Eartha Kitt recorded a new version of the song with new lyrics titled \"This Year\\'s Santa Baby\", to no commercial success. Writers listed did not change. The song was featured in the 1989 film Driving Miss Daisy.',\n",

       "  u'\"It\\'s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas\" is a classic Christmas song written in 1951 by Meredith Willson. The song was originally titled \"It\\'s Beginning to Look Like Christmas\". The song has been recorded by many artists, but was a hit by Perry Como and The Fontane Sisters with Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra on September 10, 1951. A popular but unproven belief in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, holds that Willson wrote the song while staying in Yarmouth\\'s Grand Hotel. The song makes reference to a \"tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well...\"; the park being Frost Park, directly across the road from the Grand Hotel which still operates in Yarmouth. However Grand Hotel was a popular name used by many hotels in numerous towns and cities.\\n\\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas \\nEv\\'rywhere you go; \\nTake a look in the five-and-ten, glistening once again \\nWith candy canes and silver lanes aglow. \\n\\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas, \\nToys in ev\\'ry store, \\nBut the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be\\n On your own front door. \\n\\nA pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots \\nIs the wish of Barney and Ben; \\nDolls that will talk and will go for a walk \\nIs the hope of Janice and Jen; \\nAnd Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.\\n \\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas\\n Ev\\'rywhere you go;\\n There\\'s a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,\\n The sturdy kind that doesn\\'t mind the snow.\\n \\nIt\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas;\\n Soon the bells will start,\\n And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing\\n Right within your heart.',\n",

       "  u'Train Ride from London England to Edinburgh Scotland 9-15-2009 in HD',\n",
       "  u\"I flew to London England in September. While there, I took a day trip to Scotland to see the countryside of England and Scotland. The countryside of England reminded me of the countryside of Ohio and Michigan. It was interesting to people watch, noticing the very subtle difference in facial features as compared with the average American mutt. Here in America, we have so many cultures, ethnicities  from many European and non european nations as well as the native Americans, who have over the last 2 or 3 hundred years integrated to various degrees in different parts of this country. Its rare here that an individual doesn't have 2, 3 or 4 different nationalities. In England, I had a great time talking to people at bus and subway stations, coffee houses and even at the grocery store inquiring about their background and a bit of the local history. Most of the people there are completely English, scottish or Irish - or at least the ones I talked too. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis footage was taken on my 33rd birthday 9-15-2009. I was surprised though to find graffiti in small cities in England and even Scotland. I guess subconsciously i associated graffiti with American culture.\\r\\nSince I only stayed till sunset, I walked all around Edinburgh taking pictures and video and getting lost.\\r\\nAs the sun began to lower in the clear Scottish skies, it was time to head back to Waverly station.\\r\\nIt was a beautiful day and after boarding back on the train, a beautiful sunset.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the way back I spoke the whole time to this English woman named Fionna, who bought be tea and biscuits after I mentioned it was my birthday. We talked the whole time and it was nice in that moment to really chat in depth with some one on the other side of the world whom I'd never see again. \\r\\n\\r\\nI arrived back in London just after midnight and in light rain with out an umbrella. When I stood up to exit the train, I almost fell over because of the sever pain in my feet from walking all over Edinburg from 11:00 am till 7:00 pm. The next day back in London, I stayed in to rest my feet.\",\n",

       "  u\"Travel video about destination London in England.\\nLondon is an exciting and pulsating metropolis of the new millennium, a melting pot of both people and culture and a fascinating city of diverse contrasts.\\n\\nThe City Of London contains the Tower, an historic landmark with a remarkable history. A mighty medieval fortress with 13 towers that throughout its 900 years, has served many functions and from the Middle Ages, it was a heavily fortified prison.\\n\\nAfter the medieval St. Paul's Cathedral was destroyed by a devastating fire in 1666, Christopher Wren was ordered to re-build it with a dome. During the 36 years of its construction, its design was frequently altered until finally a wonderful masterpiece of church architecture was created.\\n\\nThe Monument is the city's tallest freestanding stone column and a reminder of the Great Fire of London that destroyed 80 percent of the city. In four days, more than 13,000 buildings were destroyed and the Monument was built on the site of the bakery in which the fire began.\\n\\nSince the reign of Queen Victoria, Buckingham Palace has served as London's royal residence. A garden of mulberry trees once grew on the site of today's palace and the Duke of Buckingham subsequently added a simple brick built residence. Around 60 years later, George II purchased the site for his wife and George IV eventually began to design an extensive palace complex.\\n\\nThe highlight of any holiday in London must be the largest Ferris wheel in the world, the London Eye. Situated on the banks of the Thames, it rises high into the sky, opposite the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben.\\n\\nThe former centre of the largest empire in the world, London is still a city of superlatives that attracts millions of visitors each year. Exciting both day and night, London is a modern city with age old traditions and a long and colorful history.\\n\\n--------------\\nWatch more travel videos \\u25ba http://goo.gl/HYQdhg\\nJoin us.

       "  u'NITROGEN CYCLE:Nitrogen is the important essential element for all living organisms by the synthesis of Amino acids, proteins, Enzymesetc.What happens if there is no Nitrogen?. Root systems and plant growth are stunted.Older leaves turn yellow.Decrease in crop production. Soil microorganisms life become dangerous.In Atmosphere its concentration is 78 percentage.The circulation or cyclic movement of Nitrogen from the atmosphere physical or abiotic component to soilBiotic componentand back into the atmosphere is known as.Nitrogen cycle involves various steps:1.Nitrogen fixation. 2.Nitrogen assimilation 3. Ammonification 4. Nitrification 5. Denitrification. Plants cannot utilize Atmospheric nitrogen so it should be converted into utilizable form such as Ammonia.1.Nitrogenfixation:This is the first step of Nitrogen fixation.Conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into Ammonia for living organismsis known as Nitrogen fixation.This process is carried out by leguminous plants such as ground nut; even some bacteriacan fix atmospheric nitrogen.Examples of bacteria --Azotobacter Clostridium, Rhizobium, Nostoc and Anabaena2.NitrogenAssimilation:The process of absorbing Nitrates and Ammonia into Organic nitrogen is known as Nitrogen Assimilation.This organic nitrogen is transferred into animal\\'s body when plants are eaten by animals. 3. Ammonification:The process of converting organic nitrogen into Ammonia when Animals die is known as Ammonification.It is also known asMineralization.This process was carried out by some Saprophytes like Fungi andBacteria.Ammonia is also produced from volcanic eruptions and excretory products of Animals.4.Nitrification:The Bacteria which is involved in nitrification is known as Nitrifying bacteria.Ammonia is first converted to nitrites.Examples: Nitrosomonas,Nitrococcus.Nitrites are converted to nitratesExamples:Nitrobacter.5.Denitrification:Nitrates are converted into molecular nitrogen through Nitric oxide is known as Denitrification, in order to maintain the equilibrium of nitrogen in the atmosphere.Bacteria which are involved in denitrificationare known as denitrifying bacteria.Examples: Thiobacillusdenitrificans,Pseuodomonasdenitrificans and Micrococcusdenitrificans.Problems with increase of Nitrogen:Acid rain formation. Acidification of soil and lakes. Increase in death of plants.\\n\\n7 Active Technology Solutions Pvt.Ltd. is an educational 3D digital content provider for\\nK-12.

       "  u\"9 Things You Didn't Know About AHS \\u25ba\\u25ba http://youtu.be/yzzU6sGxatM\\nMore Celebrity News \\u25ba\\u25ba http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews\\n\\nThe Freak Show has FINALLY arrived, and if the season premiere is any indication, we\\u2019re in for one WILD ride. Yes, American Horror Story: Freak Show debuted on FX last night and it was just as creepy \\u2013 if not creepier \\u2013 than you\\u2019d imagine it to be.\\nAnd since it was a super-sized 90 minute episode, we\\u2019re going to break down five of the downright scariest moments just for you guys. And obviously, a recap means there\\u2019s going to be some spoilers, so if you\\u2019ve yet to tune in yet \\u2013 maybe you\\u2019re just waiting to watch it when it\\u2019s light outside, no judgment \\u2013 hit pause and check out this video instead \\u2013 it\\u2019s basically the ultimate preview. (CLICK THROUGH TO ANOTHER VIDEO BOX)\\nAlright, let\\u2019s get started!\\nFirst up, let\\u2019s talk about the conjoined twins Bette and Dot and the fact that, oh ya know, BETTE KILLED THEIR MOTHER! \\n\\nWhich is totally crazy because we got the vibe that Bette was the sweeter one. This just shows, you gotta watch out for the nice ones! But yes, Bette kills their mother not only because she basically locked them away for most of their lives, but Bette wants to be a STAR \\u2013 and will get rid of anyone who gets in the way of her dream.  \\nThe second moment that made all the hairs on the back of our neck stand up? Our first intro to Twisty the clown. Two kids were getting frisky by the lake when ol\\u2019 Twisty showed up to haunt all of our dreams forever. It seemed innocent enough at first but then\\u2026\\n\\nWe guess they call him a killer clown for a reason.\\nNext, there was a freaking carnie sex tape. Yes, Jessica Lange\\u2019s character became friendly with a hospital worker, from where she found Bette and Dot, and brought her along to the freak show. And well, things got FREAKY \\u2013 in more ways than one. We\\u2019re going to try to keep things PG here, but we think her reaction shot says it all.\\n\\nAnd because what AHS episode would be complete without someone dying, the next moment on our list is when Jimmy killed a cop who came looking for Bette and Dot.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s one way to keep the family together.\\nAnd last but certainly not least, this moment is really creepy, but it was definitely a highlight. Elsa Mars takes the stage to sing David Bowie\\u2019s \\u201cLife on Mars\\u201d and not only did we get to see the freak show in action, the whole thing was just AWESOME.\\n\\nOh, and a bonus highlight? We got to see that the woman in charge was a \\u201cfreak\\u201d herself as she had a private moment when she revealed that she is missing her legs.\\n\\nOh, and a bonus highlight? We got to see that the woman in charge was a \\u201cfreak\\u201d herself as she had a private moment when she revealed that she is missing her legs.\\nFor More Clevver Visit:\\nWebsite: http://www.clevver.com\\nLike us on Facebook: http://facebook.com/ClevverNews \\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/ClevverNews\\nKeep up with us on Instagram: http://instagr.am/Clevver\\nAdd us to your circles on Google+: http://google.com/+ClevverNews\\nTweet Me: http://www.twitter.com/joslyndavis\",\n",

This song is really beautiful too but the chorus is kind of odd to vid to, the time changes I think. Are you guys excited for the new Underworld with Kate Beckinsale in it though? I am!

We loved it. It combined two of the things we are working to accomplish -- inviting people to classical music and inspiring young musicians. Steven Sharp Nelson had soloed with the orchestra the previous year and loved the spirit and the talent that the orchestra showed at such young ages (ages 13-18!) Together we developed the concept of \"Beethoven\\'s 5 Secrets,\" combining OneRepublic\\'s tune \"Secrets\" with melodies and moments from all four movements of Beethoven\\'s 5th Symphony.\\n\\nWe used 5 different melodies from the 4 movements of Beethoven\\'s 5th Symphony (not including the \"bridge\" the orchestra plays in the middle). Try to guess where they are and where they come from!\\n\\nWhat are Beethoven\\'s secrets? He had many. His most prominent secret that he desperately tried to keep from the public and that caused him to be considered extremely eccentric, irritable, and hermit-like was his \"weakness.\" He was deaf during most of his life. Imagine that...one of the greatest composers that ever lived could hardly hear. And yet, he wrote his life\\'s greatest works after becoming deaf. He believed that art itself had \"secrets\" that had to be \"forced into\" in order to obtain art\\'s highest level. There is no doubt Beethoven discovered many of the \"secrets\" of art -- people all over the world enjoy them every day. He was a true master of music, blessed by God. This piece and video are dedicated to him.\\n\\n\\nFilming locations:\\nThe Mountains of St. George Utah\\nAmerican Heritage School\\nTPG Studios\\nMetCom Studio (Behind the Scenes footage)\\n\\nCredits\\n\\nArrangement written and produced by Al van der Beek & Steven Sharp Nelson\\nOrchestrated by Kayson Brown & Steven Sharp Nelson\\nPerformed by\\nAmerican Heritage Lyceum Philharmonic, under the direction of Kayson Brown\\nAdditional violin work by Julie Ann Nelson (Steven\\'s wife!) & Matthew John Nelson (Steven\\'s brother!)\\nSteven Sharp Nelson: Acoustic cello, electric cellos, percussion, vocal textures\\nAl van der Beek: Vocal textures, percussion\\nSecrets originally written by Ryan Tedder, published by SONY/ATV TUNES LLC \\nSymphony No. 5 in C Minor, Opus 67 written by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1804-1808 and debuted in Vienna\\'s Theater an der Wien in 1808\\nOrchestra recorded at MetCom Studios (http://www.metcomstudios.com) \\nAll other instruments recorded by Al van der Beek at TPG Studios\\nMixed and Mastered by Al van der Beek at TPG Studio\\nVideo produced by Paul Anderson & Tel Stewart\\n\\nDedicated to Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827)',\n",

Now you\\'re invited to hear astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, comic co-host Eugene Mirman and guest futurists Jason Silva and Melissa Sterry answer questions that lie at the intersection of technology, human biology and urban planning. Will bio-ware and nanotechnology allow humans to reprogram our biology? Can smart-materials, adaptive structures and sensor nets help city planners and policy makers create smart cities that adapt to environmental change the way forests do? Are we really approaching a \"technological singularity\" of emerging super-intelligence beyond which events cannot be predicted -- and has humanity actually experienced one before?\\n\\nCo-Host:\\nEugene Mirman, comedian\\n\\nGuests:\\nJason Silva, futurist\\nMelissa Sterry, futurist',\n",

Joseph Campbell said, \"Follow your bliss.\"  I couldn\\'t agree more with that.  My mom always said, \"Just do what you love and don\\'t worry about anything else, don\\'t worry about money, don\\'t worry about anything.  Just be kind to everyone and do what you love.\"\\r\\nAs long as you\\'re not hurting anybody else, as long as you\\'re being kind to people and you\\'re doing what you love, only good things can come of it.  Other good advices are people who claim to have absolute irrefutable faith in something without any evidence, I would not trust completely.  Yeah, I just, I\\'m a, I relate a lot to people like Carl Sagan.  I recently read one of his books that was based on a speech that he gave in a divinity school.  It\\'s interesting because Carl Sagan was one hundred percent a scientist but he was very spiritual.  I mean and he said, \"The universe gives up plenty to be spiritual about, we don\\'t need to adapt any form of dogma.\"\\r\\nLook at the evidence and to be willing to question your own truths, and to be willing to scrutinize things that you hold dearly because that way, that transparency, that self awareness will protect you from ever becoming somebody that whose beliefs somehow make them have myopic vision about what could be. So, remain open and be willing to be transformed by new information.\\r\\nRecorded on: April 14, 2009\\n\\nQuestion: What\\'s the best advice you\\'ve ever gotten?\\r\\nJason Silva: I always say that one of the best pieces of advice that I\\'ve ever gotten, has been echoed by two great thinkers, my mother Linda Mishkin and Joseph Campbell.

       "  u'Erika Ilves is an innovation strategist and author on a mission to recruit more people for the ungrateful job of starting hyper-visionary ventures.\\n\\nHow well are we, as a civilization, allocating our time and resources? If our goal was to survive and keep evolving as a species, then the answer is \"very, very poorly\". At least that is the conclusion Erika Ilves arrived at after three years of extensive research that culminated in the co-authored book \"The Human Project\". In the book, Ilves puts forward an agenda for a species that\\'s serious about its own survival. Now her life\\'s challenge is to help shift more of our civilization\\'s attention and capital out of trivial pursuits and into civilization-advancing ventures.\\n\\nAccording to Ilves, we need fewer RunPee\\'s (an app that tells you the best time to take a bathroom run at the cinema), and more Space X\\'s (a rocket company on a mission to create a multi-planetary civilization, starting with cheap, reusable rockets). She is currently working on turning The Human Project into a global campaign to get the Connected generation to think seriously about the future of our species. She is also launching road:infinity, an innovation strategy firm focused on growing a new generation of radical entrepreneurs who have the nerve to pursue visions of cosmic proportions. \\n\\nBefore embarking on her current mission, Ilves served as an executive at the iconic Norwegian technology company TANDBERG (acquired by Cicso in 2010) and spent 6 years as a consultant with McKinsey & Company where she co-led the Firm\\'s South-East Asian banking practice and managed large-scale performance transformations for banks in Asia-Pacific, Africa and Europe. She holds an LL.M. in International Business Law from the CEU/Emory Law School, a cum laude LL.B. in Law from Tartu University and was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship in 1999.\\n\\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

Song 1953 Eartha Kitt Santa Baby was originally recorded by Eartha Kitt with Henri Ren\\xe9 and his orchestra in New York City on October 6, 1953 It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 205502 in the USA, and by EMI on the His Master Voice label as catalog number B 10728 The song was a huge hit for Kitt, and she later said that it was one of her favorite songs to record; she reprised it in the 1954 film New Faces Kitt also reprised the original song in a 1963 rerecording for Kapp Records, with a more uptempo arrangement Madonna popular rendition for the 1987 charity album A Very Special Christmas is based on this latter version In 1954, Eartha Kitt recorded a new version of the song with new lyrics titled This Year Santa Baby, to no commercial success Writers listed

Uploaded & Enjoy My Christmas Everyone Home Alone SoundTrack Run Rudolph Chuck By Christmas Music Py Como It Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas RCA Victor Records 1951 It Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas is a classic Christmas song written in 1951 by Meredith Willson The song was originally titled It Beginning to Look Like Christmas The song has been recorded by many artists, but was a hit by Py Como and The Fontane Sisters with Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra on September 10, 1951 A popular but unproven belief in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, holds that Willson wrote the song while staying in Yarmouth Grand Hotel The song makes reference to a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well; the park being Frost Park, directly across the road from the Grand Hotel which still operates in Yarmouth However Grand Hotel was a popular name used by many hotels in numerous towns and citiesIt beginning to look a lot like Christmas Ev'rywhere you go; Take a look in the fiveandten, glistening once again With candy canes and silver lanes aglow It beginning to look a lot like Christmas, Toys in ev'ry store, But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be On your own front door A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots Is the wish of Barney and Ben; Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk Is the hope of Janice and Jen; And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again It beginning to look a lot like Christmas Ev'rywhere you go; There a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well, The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow It beginning to look a lot like Christmas; Soon the bells will start, And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing Right within your heart Py Como It Beginning To Look Lot Like Christmas the fontaine

i v a t e  e r r Train Ride from London England to Edinburgh Scotland 9152009 in HD I flew to London England in September While there, I took a day trip to Scotland to see the countryside of England and Scotland The countryside of England reminded me of the countryside of Ohio and Michigan It was interesting to people watch, noticing the very subtle difference in facial features as compared with the average American mutt Here in America, we have so many cultures, ethnicities from many European and non european nations as well as the native Americans, who have over the last 2 or 3 hundred years integrated to various degrees in different parts of this country Its rare here that an individual doesn't have 2, 3 or 4 different nationalities In England, I had a great time talking to people at bus and subway stations, coffee houses and even at the grocery store inquiring about their background and a bit of the local history Most of the people there are completely English, scottish or Irish or at least the ones I talked too This footage was taken on my 33rd birthday 9152009 I was surprised though to find graffiti in small cities in England and even Scotland I guess subconsciously i associated graffiti with American cultureSince I only stayed till sunset, I walked all around Edinburgh taking pictures and video and getting lostAs the sun began to lower in the clear Scottish skies, it was time to head back to Waverly stationIt was a beautiful day and after boarding back on the train, a beautiful sunsetOn the way back I spoke the whole time to this English woman named Fionna, who bought be tea and biscuits after I mentioned it was my birthday We talked the whole time and it was nice in that moment to really chat in depth with some one on the other side of the world whom I'd never see again I arrived back in London just after midnight and in light rain with out an umbrella When I stood up to exit the train, I almost fell over because of the sever pain in my feet from walking all over Edinburg from 11:00 am till 7:00 pm The next day back in London, I stayed in to rest my feet Train ride to scotland from London European vacation Bjork I've seen it all imovie canon

Didn't Know About AHS \\u25ba\\u25ba http://youtube/yzzU6sGxatMMore Celebrity News \\u25ba\\u25ba http://bitly/SubClevverNewsThe Freak Show has FINALLY arrived, and if the season premiere is any indication, we\\u2019re in for one WILD ride Yes, American Horror Story: Freak Show debuted on FX last night and it was just as creepy \\u2013 if not creepier \\u2013 than you\\u2019d imagine it to beAnd since it was a supersized 90 minute episode, we\\u2019re going to break down five of the downright scariest moments just for you guys And obviously, a recap means there\\u2019s going to be some spoilers, so if you\\u2019ve yet to tune in yet \\u2013 maybe you\\u2019re just waiting to watch it when it\\u2019s light outside, no judgment \\u2013 hit pause and check out this video instead \\u2013 it\\u2019s basically the ultimate preview CLICK THROUGH TO ANOTHER VIDEO BOXAlright, let\\u2019s get startedFirst up, let\\u2019s talk about the conjoined twins Bette and Dot and the fact that, oh ya know, BETTE KILLED THEIR MOTHER Which is totally crazy because we got the vibe that Bette was the sweeter one This just shows, you gotta watch out for the nice ones But yes, Bette kills their mother not only because she basically locked them away for most of their lives, but Bette wants to be a STAR \\u2013 and will get rid of anyone who gets in the way of her dream The second moment that made all the hairs on the back of our neck stand up Our first intro to Twisty the clown Two kids were getting frisky by the lake when ol\\u2019 Twisty showed up to haunt all of our dreams forever It seemed innocent enough at first but then\\u2026We guess they call him a killer clown for a reasonNext, there was a freaking carnie sex tape Yes, Jessica Lange\\u2019s character became friendly with a hospital worker, from where she found Bette and Dot, and brought her along to the freak show And well, things got FREAKY \\u2013 in more ways than one We\\u2019re going to try to keep things PG here, but we think her reaction shot says it allAnd because what AHS episode would be complete without someone dying, the next moment on our list is when Jimmy killed a cop who came looking for Bette and DotThat\\u2019s one way to keep the family togetherAnd last but certainly not least, this moment is really creepy, but it was definitely a highlight Elsa Mars takes the stage to sing David Bowie\\u2019s \\u201cLife on Mars\\u201d and not only did we get to see the freak show in action, the whole thing was just AWESOMEOh, and a bonus highlight We got to see that the woman in charge was a \\u201cfreak\\u201d herself as she had a moment when she revealed that she is missing her legsOh, and a bonus highlight We got to see that the woman in charge was a \\u201cfreak\\u201d herself as she

and its director, Kayson Brown, approached us with this idea We loved it It combined two of the things we are working to accomplish inviting people to classical music and inspiring young musicians Steven Sharp Nelson had soloed with the orchestra the previous year and loved the spirit and the talent that the orchestra showed at such young ages ages 1318 Together we developed the concept of Beethoven 5 Secrets, combining OneRepublic tune Secrets with melodies and moments from all four movements of Beethoven 5th SymphonyWe used 5 different melodies from the 4 movements of Beethoven 5th Symphony not including the bridge the orchestra plays in the middle Try to guess where they are and where they come fromWhat are Beethoven secrets He had many His most prominent secret that he desperately tried to keep from the public and that caused him to be considered extremely eccentric, irritable, and hermitlike was his weakness He was deaf during most of his life Imagine thatone of the greatest composers that ever lived could hardly hear And yet, he wrote his life greatest works after becoming deaf He believed that art itself had secrets that had to be forced into in order to obtain art highest level There is no doubt Beethoven discovered many of the secrets of art people all over the world enjoy them every day He was a true master of music, blessed by God This piece and video are dedicated to himFilming locations:The Mountains of St George UtahAmerican Heritage SchoolTPG StudiosMetCom Studio Behind the Scenes footageCreditsArrangement written and produced by Al van

http://wwwtwittercom/PianoGuysStory behind TPG Story of My LifeAs we began our arrangement of One Direction Story of My Life we wanted it to feel like each note of the music was a word in a vivid story being told When writing a song sometimes you just need a little spark That catalyst came from a piece of classical music one that had such a storybook feel to it that we gleaned inspiration from it: SaintSa\\xebns' Aquarium from his Suite Carnival of the Animals It an incredibly beautiful and transportive piece You can listen to it here: https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=XCBDlC0N8Rc When we were finished we all stepped back and listened as objectively as we could, imagining what sort of story was being told in order to identify the best places to film What happened surprised us all The story

advice you've ever gottenJason Silva: I always say that one of the best pieces of advice that I've ever gotten, has been echoed by two great thinkers, my mother Linda Mishkin and Joseph Campbell Joseph Campbell said, Follow your bliss I couldn't agree more with that My mom always said, Just do what you love and don't worry about anything else, don't worry about money, don't worry about anything Just be kind to everyone and do what you loveAs long as you're not hurting anybody else, as long as you're being kind to people and you're doing what you love, only good things can come of it Other good advices are people who claim to have absolute irrefutable faith in something without any evidence, I would not trust completely Yeah, I just, I'm a, I relate a lot to people like Carl Sagan I recently read one of his books that was based on a speech that he gave in a divinity school It interesting because Carl Sagan was one hundred percent a scientist but he was very spiritual I mean and he said, The universe gives up plenty to be spiritual about, we don't need to adapt any form of dogmaLook at the evidence and to be willing to question your own truths, and to be willing to scrutinize things that you hold dearly because that way, that transparency, that self awareness will protect you from ever becoming somebody that whose beliefs somehow make them have myopic vision about what could be So, remain open and be willing to be transformed by new informationRecorded on: April 14, 2009Question: What the best advice you've ever gottenJason Silva: I always say that one of the best

well are we, as a civilization, allocating our time and resources If our goal was to survive and keep evolving as a species, then the answer is very, very poorly At least that is the conclusion Erika Ilves arrived at after three years of extensive research that culminated in the coauthored book The Human Project In the book, Ilves puts forward an agenda for a species that serious about its own survival Now her life challenge is to help shift more of our civilization attention and capital out of trivial pursuits and into civilizationadvancing venturesAccording to Ilves, we need fewer RunPee an app that tells you the best time to take a bathroom run at the cinema, and more Space X a rocket company on a mission to create a multiplanetary civilization, starting with cheap, reusable rockets She is currently working on turning The Human Project into a global campaign to get the Connected generation to think seriously about the future of our species She is also launching road:infinity, an innovation strategy firm focused on growing a new generation of radical entrepreneurs who have the nerve to pursue visions of cosmic proportions Before embarking on her current mission, Ilves served as an executive at the iconic Norwegian technology company TANDBERG acquired by Cicso in 2010 and spent 6 years as a consultant with McKinsey & Company where she coled the Firm SouthEast Asian banking practice and managed largescale performance transformations for banks in AsiaPacific, Africa and Europe She holds an LLM in International Business Law from the CEU/Emory Law School, a cum laude LLB in Law from Tartu University and was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship in 1999In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, selforganized events that bring people together to share a

you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goStaring at the bottom of your glassHoping one day you'll make a dream lastBut dreams come slow and they go so fastYou see her when you close your eyesMaybe one day you'll understand whyEverything you touch surely diesBut you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goStaring at the ceiling in the darkSame old empty feeling in your heart'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fastWell you see her when you fall asleepBut never to touch and never to keep'Cause you loved her too muchAnd you dived too deepWell you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goAnd you let her goWell you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when

little birds, sat on my windowAnd they told me I don't need to worrySummer came like cinnamonSo sweet,Little girls DoubleDutch on the concreteMaybe sometimes, we've got it wrong, but it alrightThe more things seem to change, the more they stay the sameOh, don't you hesitate[Chorus]Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite songYou go ahead, let your hair downSapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,Just go ahead, let your hair downYou're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow[Verse 2]Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely,Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside,just relax, just relaxDon't you let those other boys fool you,Got to love that afro hair doMaybe sometimes, we feel afraid, but it alrightThe more you stay the same, the more they seem to changeDon't you think it strange[Chorus]Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite songYou go ahead, let your hair downSapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,Just go ahead, let your hair downYou're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow'[Verse 3]Twas more than I could take, pity for pity sakeSome nights kept me awake, I thought that I was strongerWhen you gonna realise, that you don't even have to try any longerDo what you want to[Chorus]Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite songYou go ahead, let your hair downSapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,Just go ahead, let your hair downGirl, put your records on, tell me your favourite songYou go ahead, let your hair downSapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,Just go ahead, let your hair downOh, you're gonna

yourself with one of the toughest interview questions, tell me about yourselfThis is an openended question, but really what the interviewer wants to hear is about your recent work experience Why don't they just ask that question Because they want to see where you will go with an openended question Your answer tells the interviewer where your mind is If you start telling him that you are a Cleveland Browns fan, then you are way off base with what he wants to hear and you have just made your first mistake What do you want the interviewer to know about you when you leave, your work experience or your personal interests I'm confident their hiring decision will be based on your work experience, save your personal interests for the water cooler after you get the jobWrong answer to tell me about

successful at this job Even if you don't feel that you accomplished anything, look deep and think of something you did that helped the company Or better yet, describe an accomplishment that you contributed to the company, just make sure it in the same line of work For example, don't take credit for boosting sales revenue if your job is to fix computers\\u2022 Briefly talk about your current employer\\u2022 Discuss 23 of your most significant accomplishments\\u2022 Talk about a few of your key strengths as they relate to the job for which you are applying and how they can benefit from

LYRICS:There a humming in the restless summer airAnd we're slipping off the course that we preparedBut in all chaos, there is calculationDropping glasses just to hear them breakYou've been drinking like the world was gonna end it didn'tTook a shiner from the fist of your best friend go figureIt clear that someone gotta goWe mean it, but I promise we're not meanAnd the cry goes outThey lose their minds for usAnd how it plays outNow we're in the ringAnd we're coming for bloodYou can try and take usBut we're the gladiatorsEveryone a ragerBut secretly they're saviorsGlory and gore go hand and handThat why we're making headlinesYou can try and take usBut victory contagiousDelicate in every way but one the swordplayGod know we like archaic kinds of fun the old wayChance is the only game I play with, babyWe let our battle choose us[Chorus]No one 'round here good at keeping their eyes closedThe sun starting to light up when we're walking homeTired little laughs, goldlie promisesWe'll always win at thisI don't ever thing about deathIt alright if you do, it fineWe gladiate but I guess we're really fighting ourselvesRoughing up our minds so we're ready when the killtime comesWide awake in bed, words in my brain:Secretly you love this, do you even wanna go freeLet me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means[Chorus] lorde glory and gore 400 lux buzzcut season team

Song 1953 Eartha Kitt Santa Baby was originally recorded by Eartha Kitt with Henri Ren\\xe9 and his orchestra in New York City on October 6, 1953 It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 205502 in the USA, and by EMI on the His Master Voice label as catalog number B 10728 The song was a huge hit for Kitt, and she later said that it was one of her favorite songs to record; she reprised it in the 1954 film New Faces Kitt also reprised the original song in a 1963 rerecording for Kapp Records, with a more uptempo arrangement Madonna popular rendition for the 1987 charity album

Uploaded & Enjoy My Christmas Everyone Home Alone SoundTrack Run Rudolph Chuck By Christmas Music Py Como It Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas RCA Victor Records 1951 It Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas is a classic Christmas song written in 1951 by Meredith Willson The song was originally titled It Beginning to Look Like Christmas The song has been recorded by many artists, but was a hit by Py Como and The Fontane Sisters with Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra on September 10, 1951 A popular but unproven belief in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, holds that Willson wrote the song while staying in Yarmouth Grand Hotel The song makes reference to a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well; the park being Frost Park, directly across the road from the Grand Hotel which still operates in Yarmouth However Grand Hotel was a popular name used by many hotels in numerous towns and citiesIt beginning to look a lot like Christmas Ev'rywhere you go; Take a look in the fiveandten, glistening once again With candy canes and silver lanes aglow It beginning to look a lot like Christmas, Toys in ev'ry store, But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be On your own front door A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots Is the wish of Barney and Ben; Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk Is the hope of Janice and Jen; And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again It beginning to look a lot like Christmas Ev'rywhere you go; There a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well, The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow It beginning to look a lot like Christmas; Soon the bells will start, And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing Right within your heart Py Como It Beginning To Look Lot Like Christmas the fontaine

i v a t e  e r r Train Ride from London England to Edinburgh Scotland 9152009 in HD I flew to London England in September While there, I took a day trip to Scotland to see the countryside of England and Scotland The countryside of England reminded me of the countryside of Ohio and Michigan It was interesting to people watch, noticing the very subtle difference in facial features as compared with the average American mutt Here in America, we have so many cultures, ethnicities from many European and non european nations as well as the native Americans, who have over the last 2 or 3 hundred years integrated to various degrees in different parts of this country Its rare here that an individual doesn't have 2, 3 or 4 different nationalities In England, I had a great time talking to people at bus and subway stations, coffee houses and even at the grocery store inquiring about their background and a bit of the local history Most of the people there are completely English, scottish or Irish or at least the ones I talked too This footage was taken on my 33rd birthday 9152009 I was surprised though to find graffiti in small cities in England and even Scotland I guess subconsciously i associated graffiti with American cultureSince I only stayed till sunset, I walked all around Edinburgh taking pictures and video and getting lostAs the sun began to lower in the clear Scottish skies, it was time to head back to Waverly stationIt was a beautiful day and after boarding back on the train, a beautiful sunsetOn the way back I spoke the whole time to this English woman named Fionna, who bought be tea and biscuits after I mentioned it was my birthday We talked the whole time and it was nice in that moment to really chat in depth with some one on the other side of the world whom I'd never see again I arrived back in London just after midnight and in light rain with out an umbrella When I stood up to exit the train, I almost fell over because of the sever pain in my feet from walking all over Edinburg from 11:00 am till 7:00 pm The next day back in London, I stayed in to rest my feet Train ride to scotland from London European vacation Bjork I've seen it all imovie canon

Song 1953 Eartha Kitt Santa Baby was originally recorded by Eartha Kitt with Henri Ren\\xe9 and his orchestra in New York City on October 6, 1953 It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 205502 in the USA, and by EMI on the His Master Voice label as catalog number B 10728 The song was a huge hit for Kitt, and she later said that it was one of her favorite songs to record; she

Uploaded & Enjoy My Christmas Everyone Home Alone SoundTrack Run Rudolph Chuck By Christmas Music Py Como It Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas RCA Victor Records 1951 It Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas is a classic Christmas song written in 1951 by Meredith Willson The song was originally titled It Beginning to Look Like Christmas The song has been recorded by many artists, but was a hit by Py Como and The Fontane Sisters with Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra on September 10, 1951 A popular but unproven belief in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, holds that Willson wrote the song while staying in Yarmouth Grand Hotel The song makes reference to a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well; the park being Frost Park, directly across the road from the Grand Hotel which still operates in Yarmouth However Grand Hotel was a popular name used by many hotels in numerous towns and citiesIt beginning to look a lot like Christmas Ev'rywhere you go; Take a look in the fiveandten, glistening once again With candy canes and silver lanes aglow It beginning to look a lot like Christmas, Toys in ev'ry store, But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be On your own front door A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots Is the wish of Barney and Ben; Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk Is the hope of Janice and Jen; And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again It beginning to look a lot like Christmas Ev'rywhere you go; There a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well, The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow It beginning to look a lot like Christmas; Soon the bells will start, And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing Right within your heart Py Como It Beginning To Look Lot Like Christmas the fontaine

i v a t e  e r r Train Ride from London England to Edinburgh Scotland 9152009 in HD I flew to London England in September While there, I took a day trip to Scotland to see the countryside of England and Scotland The countryside of England reminded me of the countryside of Ohio and Michigan It was interesting to people watch, noticing the very subtle difference in facial features as compared with the average American mutt Here in America, we have so many cultures, ethnicities from many European and non european nations as well as the native Americans, who have over the last 2 or 3 hundred years integrated to various degrees in different parts of this country Its rare here that an individual doesn't have 2, 3 or 4 different nationalities In England, I had a great time talking to people at bus and subway stations, coffee houses and even at the grocery store inquiring about their background and a bit of the local history Most of the people there are completely English, scottish or Irish or at least the ones I talked too This footage was taken on my 33rd birthday 9152009 I was surprised though to find graffiti in small cities in England and even Scotland I guess subconsciously i associated graffiti with American cultureSince I only stayed till sunset, I walked all around Edinburgh taking pictures and video and getting lostAs the sun began to lower in the clear Scottish skies, it was time to head back to Waverly stationIt was a beautiful day and after boarding back on the train, a beautiful sunsetOn the way back I spoke the whole time to this English woman named Fionna, who bought be tea and biscuits after I mentioned it was my birthday We talked the whole time and it was nice in that moment to really chat in depth with some one on the other side of the world whom I'd never see again I arrived back in London just after midnight and in light rain with out an umbrella When I stood up to exit the train, I almost fell over because of the sever pain in my feet from

Like Christmas is a classic Christmas song written in 1951 by Meredith Willson The song was originally titled It Beginning to Look Like Christmas The song has been recorded by many artists, but was a hit by Py Como and The Fontane Sisters with Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra on September 10, 1951 A popular but unproven belief in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, holds that Willson wrote the song while staying in Yarmouth Grand Hotel The song makes reference to a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well; the park being Frost Park, directly across the road from the Grand Hotel which still operates in Yarmouth However Grand Hotel was a popular name used by many hotels in numerous towns and citiesIt beginning to look a lot like Christmas Ev'rywhere you go; Take a look in the fiveandten, glistening once again With candy canes and silver lanes aglow It beginning to look a lot like Christmas, Toys in ev'ry store, But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be On your own front door A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots Is the wish of Barney and Ben; Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk Is the hope of Janice and Jen; And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again It beginning to look a lot like Christmas Ev'rywhere you go; There a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well, The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow It beginning to look a lot like Christmas; Soon the bells will start, And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing Right within your heart Py Como It Beginning To Look Lot Like Christmas the fontaine

Uploaded & Enjoy My Christmas Everyone Home Alone SoundTrack Run Rudolph Chuck By Christmas Music Py Como It Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas RCA Victor Records 1951 It Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas is a classic Christmas song written in 1951 by Meredith Willson The song was originally titled It Beginning to Look Like Christmas The song has been recorded by many artists, but was a hit by Py Como and The Fontane Sisters with Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra on September 10, 1951 A popular but unproven belief in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, holds that Willson wrote the song while staying in Yarmouth Grand Hotel The song makes reference to a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well; the park being Frost Park, directly across the road from the Grand Hotel which still operates in Yarmouth However Grand Hotel was a popular name used by many hotels in numerous towns and citiesIt beginning to look a lot like Christmas Ev'rywhere you go; Take a look in the fiveandten, glistening once again With candy canes and silver lanes aglow It beginning to look a lot like Christmas, Toys in ev'ry store, But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be On your own front door A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots Is the wish of Barney and Ben; Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk Is the hope of Janice and Jen; And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again It beginning to look a lot like Christmas Ev'rywhere you go; There a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well, The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow It beginning to look a lot like Christmas; Soon the bells will start, And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing Right within your heart Py Como It Beginning To Look Lot Like Christmas the fontaine

i v a t e  e r r Train Ride from London England to Edinburgh Scotland 9152009 in HD I flew to London England in September While there, I took a day trip to Scotland to see the countryside of England and Scotland The countryside of England reminded me of the countryside of Ohio and Michigan It was interesting to people watch, noticing the very subtle difference in facial features as compared with the average American mutt Here in America, we have so many cultures, ethnicities from many European and non european nations as well as the native Americans, who have over the last 2 or 3 hundred years integrated to various degrees in different parts of this country Its rare here that an individual doesn't have 2, 3 or 4 different nationalities In England, I had a great time talking to people at bus and subway stations, coffee houses and even at the grocery store inquiring about their background and a bit of the local history Most of the people there are completely English, scottish or Irish or at least the ones I talked too This footage was taken on my 33rd birthday 9152009 I was surprised though to find graffiti in small cities in England and even Scotland I guess subconsciously i associated graffiti with American cultureSince I only stayed till sunset, I walked all around Edinburgh taking pictures and video and getting lostAs the sun began to lower in the clear Scottish skies, it was time to head back to Waverly stationIt was a beautiful day and after boarding back on the train, a beautiful sunsetOn the way back I spoke the whole time to this English woman named Fionna, who bought be tea and biscuits after I mentioned it was my birthday We talked the whole time and it was nice in that moment to really chat in depth with some one on the other side of the world whom I'd never see again I arrived back in London just after midnight and in light rain with out an umbrella When I stood up to exit the train, I almost fell over because of the sever pain in my feet from walking all over Edinburg from 11:00 am till 7:00 pm The next day back in London, I stayed in to rest my feet Train ride to scotland from London European vacation Bjork I've seen it all imovie canon

900 years, has served many functions and from the Middle Ages, it was a heavily fortified prisonAfter the medieval St Paul Cathedral was destroyed by a devastating fire in 1666, Christopher Wren was

built on the site of the bakery in which the fire beganSince the reign of Queen Victoria, Buckingham Palace has served as London royal residence A garden of mulby trees once grew on the site of today palace and the Duke of Buckingham subsequently added a simple brick built residence Around 60 years later, George II purchased the site for his wife and George IV eventually began to design an

could leave this town and run foreverLet your waves crash down on me and take me awayThere a piece of you that here with meIt everywhere I go, it everything I seeWhen I sleep, I dream and it gets me

togetherLet your waves crash down on me and take me awayI remember the look in your eyesWhen I told you that this was goodbyeYou were begging me not tonightNot here, not nowWe're looking up at the same night skyAnd keep pretending the sun will not rise Be together for one more nightSomewhere, somehowIf I could find you now things would get betterWe could leave this town and run foreverI know

important essential element for all living organisms by the synthesis of Amino acids, proteins, EnzymesetcWhat happens if there is no Nitrogen Root systems and plant growth are stuntedOlder leaves turn yellowDecrease in crop production Soil microorganisms life become dangerousIn Atmosphere its concentration is 78 percentageThe circulation or cyclic movement of Nitrogen from the atmosphere physical or abiotic component to soilBiotic componentand back into the atmosphere is known asNitrogen cycle involves various steps:1Nitrogen fixation 2Nitrogen assimilation 3 Ammonification 4 Nitrification 5 Denitrification Plants cannot utilize Atmospheric nitrogen so it should be converted into utilizable form such as Ammonia1Nitrogenfixation:This is the first step of Nitrogen fixationConversion of atmospheric nitrogen into Ammonia for living organismsis known as Nitrogen fixationThis process is carried out by leguminous plants such as ground nut; even some bacteriacan fix atmospheric nitrogenExamples of bacteria Azotobacter Clostridium, Rhizobium, Nostoc and Anabaena2NitrogenAssimilation:The process of absorbing Nitrates and Ammonia into Organic nitrogen is known as Nitrogen AssimilationThis organic nitrogen is transfed into animal body when plants are eaten by animals 3 Ammonification:The process of converting organic nitrogen into Ammonia when Animals die is known as AmmonificationIt is also known asMineralizationThis process was carried out by some Saprophytes like Fungi andBacteriaAmmonia is also produced from volcanic eruptions and excretory products of Animals4Nitrification:The Bacteria which is involved in nitrification is known as Nitrifying bacteriaAmmonia is first converted to nitritesExamples: Nitrosomonas,NitrococcusNitrites are converted to nitratesExamples:Nitrobacter5Denitrification:Nitrates are converted into molecular nitrogen through Nitric oxide is known as Denitrification, in order to maintain the equilibrium of nitrogen in the atmosphereBacteria which are involved in denitrificationare known as denitrifying bacteriaExamples: Thiobacillusdenitrificans,Pseuodomonasdenitrificans and MicrococcusdenitrificansProblems with increase of Nitrogen:Acid rain formation Acidification of soil and lakes Increase in death of plants7 Active Technology Solutions PvtLtd is an educational 3D digital content provider forK12 We also

http://youtube/yzzU6sGxatMMore Celebrity News \\u25ba\\u25ba http://bitly/SubClevverNewsThe Freak Show has FINALLY arrived, and if the season premiere is any indication, we\\u2019re in for one WILD ride Yes, American Horror Story: Freak Show debuted on FX last night and it was just as creepy \\u2013 if not creepier \\u2013 than you\\u2019d imagine it to beAnd since it was a supersized 90 minute episode, we\\u2019re going to break down five of the downright scariest moments just for you guys And obviously, a recap means there\\u2019s going to be some spoilers, so if you\\u2019ve yet to tune in yet \\u2013 maybe you\\u2019re just waiting to watch it when it\\u2019s light outside, no judgment \\u2013 hit pause and check out this video instead \\u2013 it\\u2019s basically the ultimate preview CLICK THROUGH TO ANOTHER VIDEO BOXAlright, let\\u2019s get startedFirst up, let\\u2019s talk about the conjoined twins Bette and Dot and the fact that, oh ya know, BETTE KILLED THEIR MOTHER Which is totally crazy because we got the vibe that Bette was the sweeter one This just shows, you gotta watch out for the nice ones But yes, Bette kills their mother not only because she basically locked them away for most of their lives, but Bette wants to be a STAR \\u2013 and will get rid of anyone who gets in the way of her dream The second moment that made all the hairs on the back of our neck stand up Our first intro to Twisty the clown Two kids were getting frisky by the lake when ol\\u2019 Twisty showed up to haunt all of our dreams forever It seemed innocent enough at first but then\\u2026We guess they call him a killer clown for a reasonNext, there was a freaking carnie sex tape Yes, Jessica Lange\\u2019s character became friendly with a hospital worker, from where she found Bette and Dot, and brought her along to the freak show And well, things got FREAKY \\u2013 in more ways than one We\\u2019re going to try to keep things PG here, but we think her reaction shot says it allAnd because what AHS episode would be complete without someone dying, the next moment on our list is when Jimmy killed a cop who came looking for Bette and DotThat\\u2019s one way to keep the family togetherAnd last but certainly not least, this moment is really creepy, but it was definitely a highlight Elsa Mars takes the stage to sing David Bowie\\u2019s \\u201cLife on Mars\\u201d and not only did we get to see the freak show in action, the whole thing was just AWESOMEOh, and a bonus highlight We got to see that the woman in charge was a \\u201cfreak\\u201d herself as she had a moment when she revealed that she is missing her legsOh, and a bonus highlight We got to see that the woman in charge was a \\u201cfreak\\u201d herself as she had a moment when she revealed that she

Philharmonic Youth Orchestra and its director, Kayson Brown, approached us with this idea We loved it It combined two of the things we are working to accomplish inviting people to classical music and inspiring young musicians Steven Sharp Nelson had soloed with the orchestra the previous year and loved the spirit and the talent that the orchestra showed at such young ages ages 1318 Together we developed the concept of Beethoven 5 Secrets, combining OneRepublic tune Secrets with melodies and moments from all four movements of Beethoven 5th SymphonyWe used 5 different melodies from the 4 movements of Beethoven 5th Symphony not including the bridge the orchestra plays in the middle Try to guess where they are and where they come fromWhat are Beethoven secrets He had many His most prominent secret that he desperately tried to keep from the public and that caused him to be considered extremely eccentric, irritable, and hermitlike was his weakness He was deaf during most of his life Imagine thatone of the greatest composers that ever lived could hardly hear And yet, he wrote his life greatest works after becoming deaf He believed that art itself had secrets that had to be forced into in order to obtain art highest level There is no doubt Beethoven discovered many of the secrets of art people all over the world enjoy them every day He was a true master of music, blessed by God This piece and video are dedicated to himFilming locations:The Mountains of St George UtahAmerican Heritage SchoolTPG StudiosMetCom Studio Behind the Scenes footageCreditsArrangement written

like each note of the music was a word in a vivid story being told When writing a song sometimes you just need a little spark That catalyst came from a piece of classical music one that had such a storybook feel to it that we gleaned inspiration from it: SaintSa\\xebns' Aquarium from his Suite Carnival of the Animals It an incredibly beautiful and transportive piece You can listen to it here: https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=XCBDlC0N8Rc When we were finished we all stepped back and listened as objectively as we could, imagining what sort of story was being told in order to identify the best places to film What happened surprised us all The story itself took over It was like film score but in reverse more here: http://smarturlit/TPGStoryOfMyLifeCreditsStory of My Life One Direction

advice you've ever gottenJason Silva: I always say that one of the best pieces of advice that I've ever gotten, has been echoed by two great thinkers, my mother Linda Mishkin and Joseph Campbell Joseph Campbell said, Follow your bliss I couldn't agree more with that My mom always said, Just do what you love and don't worry about anything else, don't worry about money, don't worry about anything Just be kind to everyone and do what you loveAs long as you're not hurting anybody else, as long as you're being kind to people and you're doing what you love, only good things can come of it Other good advices are people who claim to have absolute irrefutable faith in something without any evidence, I would not trust completely Yeah, I just, I'm a, I relate a lot to people like Carl Sagan I recently read one of his books that was based on a speech that he gave in a divinity school It interesting because Carl Sagan was one hundred percent a scientist but he was very spiritual I mean and he said, The universe gives up plenty to be spiritual about, we don't need to adapt any form of dogmaLook at the evidence and to be willing to question your own truths, and to be willing to scrutinize things that you hold dearly because that way, that transparency, that self awareness will protect you from ever becoming somebody that whose beliefs somehow make them have myopic vision about what could be So, remain open and be willing to be transformed by new informationRecorded on: April 14, 2009Question: What the best advice you've ever gottenJason Silva: I always say that one of the best

find our inner peace Make it everlastingSo nothing incompleteIt easy being with you, sacred simplicityAs long as we're together, there no place I'd rather be With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, strolling so casually,We're different and the sameGet you another nameSwitch up the batteryIf you gave me a chanceI would take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou

you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goStaring at the bottom of your glassHoping one day you'll make a dream lastBut dreams come slow and they go so fastYou see her when you close your eyesMaybe one day you'll understand whyEverything you touch surely diesBut you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goStaring at the ceiling in the darkSame old empty feeling in your heart'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fastWell you see her when you fall asleepBut never to touch and never to keep'Cause you loved her too muchAnd you dived too deepWell you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goAnd you let her goWell you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when

take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou can't shake meWhen I am with youThere no place I'd rather beNo no no no noNo place I'd rather beWe set out on a mission to find our inner peace Make it everlastingSo nothing incompleteIt easy being with you, sacred simplicityAs long as we're together, there no place I'd rather be With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, strolling so casually,We're different and the sameGet you another nameSwitch up the batteryIf you gave me a chanceI would take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou

you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goStaring at the bottom of your glassHoping one day you'll make a dream lastBut dreams come slow and they go so fastYou see her when you close your eyesMaybe one day you'll understand whyEverything you touch surely diesBut you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goStaring at the ceiling in the darkSame old empty feeling in your heart'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fastWell you see her when you fall asleepBut never to touch and never to keep'Cause you loved her too muchAnd you dived too deepWell you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goAnd you let her goWell you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her go Passenger Ed Sheeran Musical

EhrpunktEditor: Kolja FraseThe Dog: DonAn EASYdoesit ProductionIs club music allowed to be melancholy once in awhile Absolutely, it even has to be At least when the French alternativepopfolk superstars Nili Hadida and Benjamin Cotto, alias Lilly Wood & The Prick, have their way Their haunting melody Prayer in C was quickly snatched up by the DJ, producer and label owner Robin Schulz from Osnabruck, Germany, and sublimated into a shining dancefloor pearlAt the beginning of this year the head of Lausbuben Records Rascal Records and star DJ Robin Schulz already entered the Top 40 of the German iTunes charts with his single Sunset Last March he shoved none less than Pharrell Williams from the charts throne with his Waves remix for the Dutch rapper Mr Probz and took a cosy position at Number One in the German singles, iTunes, airplay and dance hitparade charts But this is not all because Robin Schulz is more than successful on an international level The Waves remix stayed at #24 in the global iTunes Single Charts, at #21 in the global Spotify Charts and has held a Top 10 position in the Beatport Charts for more than three months Following acclaimed live appearances in Germany, Holland, France and the UK, the Soundcloudplays millionaire reached into his electronic bag of tricks and delivers a preview for the upcoming summer holidays with his deep house style remix of Lilly Wood & The Prick Prayer in CIt a superstar collaboration: Prayer in C is the acoustic counterpart to an open air summer party night in the Provence: the scent of lavender in the air and an atmosphere somewhere between melancholy and euphoria The track is driven by the absolutely captivating, goosebumpinducing voice of Nili Hadidas, who with her sexysmoky timbre, the haunting lyrics as well as Benjamin Cotto wistful acoustic guitar melody create the organic vibe The Robin Schulz remix underlays the track with a tight straighton beat that transforms the original folkpop track into an energic melodyhouse club hymn And Schulz must know how to do it: nearly 113,000 Soundcloud followers, who clicked his tracks several million times altogether, can't be wrong for example, Willst Du has more than 12 million clicks or Sunset more than 820,000 And also his YouTube videos for his bootlegs with millions of clicks show that Robin Schulz knows how to seize the latest sound and serve it up to the masses in a sizzling new package At the moment Robin Schulz is experiencing the hottest clubs in Europe on an extending tour And the original creators of the track, the Paris duo Lilly Wood & The Prick don't have to play themselves down as far as fame is concerned At home in France, the duo advanced to genuine superstars following their doubleplatinum debut abum At the beginning of the year, one album track, Into Trouble was used in a TV spot for the noble jewelry brand Cartier Together with Robin Schulz they deliver the next club diamond with Prayer in C Robin Schulz Remix Berlin electro

with you, my heart continues to beatWith every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, strolling so casually,We're different and the sameGet you another nameSwitch up the batteryIf you gave me a chanceI would take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou can't shake meWhen I am with youThere no place I'd rather beNo no no no noNo place I'd rather beWe set out on a mission to find our inner peace Make it everlastingSo nothing incompleteIt easy being with you, sacred simplicityAs long as we're together, there no place I'd rather be With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, strolling so casually,We're different and the sameGet you another nameSwitch up the batteryIf you gave me a chanceI would take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou

you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goStaring at the bottom of your glassHoping one day you'll make a dream lastBut dreams come slow and they go so fastYou see her when you close your eyesMaybe one day you'll understand whyEverything you touch surely diesBut you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goStaring at the ceiling in the darkSame old empty feeling in your heart'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fastWell you see her when you fall asleepBut never to touch and never to keep'Cause you loved her too muchAnd you dived too deepWell you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goAnd you let her goWell you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her go Passenger Ed Sheeran Musical

never worksBut you can lay with meSo it doesn't hurtOh won't youStay with meCos you'reAll I needThis aint loveIt clear to seeBut darlingStay with meOh won't youStay with meCos you'reAll I needThis aint loveIt clear to seeBut darlingStay with meMusic video by Sam Smith performing Stay With Me C 2014 Capitol Records Ltd Sam Smith Stay With Me Capitol Popj Disclosure Naughty Boy debut new song new

with you, my heart continues to beatWith every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, strolling so casually,We're different and the sameGet you another nameSwitch up the batteryIf you gave me a chanceI would take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou can't shake meWhen I am with youThere no place I'd rather beNo no no no noNo place I'd rather beWe set out on a mission to find our inner peace Make it everlastingSo nothing incompleteIt easy being with you, sacred simplicityAs long as we're together, there no place I'd rather be With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, strolling so casually,We're different and the sameGet you another nameSwitch up the batteryIf you gave me a chanceI would take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou

you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goStaring at the bottom of your glassHoping one day you'll make a dream lastBut dreams come slow and they go so fastYou see her when you close your eyesMaybe one day you'll understand whyEverything you touch surely diesBut you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goStaring at the ceiling in the darkSame old empty feeling in your heart'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fastWell you see her when you fall asleepBut never to touch and never to keep'Cause you loved her too muchAnd you dived too deepWell you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goAnd you let her goWell you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her go Passenger Ed Sheeran Musical

bottom of the pageDon is the #1 MostStrategic Job Interview Coach in America and author of 3 bestselling books http://wwwjobinterviewtoolscomGood interview answer to Tell me about yourselfWatch Don show you exactly how to tell interviewers about yourself with one of the toughest interview questions, tell me about yourselfThis is an openended question, but really what the interviewer wants to hear is about your recent work experience Why don't they just ask that question Because they want to see where you will go with an openended question Your answer tells the interviewer where your mind is If you start telling him that you are a Cleveland Browns fan, then you are way off base with what he wants to hear and you have just made your first mistake What do you want the interviewer to know about you when you leave, your work experience or your personal interests I'm confident their hiring decision will be based on your work experience, save your personal interests for the water cooler after you get the jobWrong answer to tell me about yourself: 1 What would you like to know This statement completely throws the question back at the interviewer in somewhat of an insulting way and he/she is forced to reword the questionBest answer to tell me about yourself:1 What part of my work experience would you like me to talk about a Now the interviewer can reply with a simple straightforward answer Some interviewers want you to start from your first job and others only want to hear about your most recent job b If the interviewer would like you to start from your first job, assuming it has been several years since you had that job, then lightly touch on the jobs that you no longer hold, but expand on your current or most recent job experience and accomplishmentsFocus on your answer and talk about your accomplishments from your current or most recent job and lightly touch on your daily duties These are the things an interviewer really wants to hear Because if he thinks you were successful at your past job, then you will be successful at this job Even if you don't feel that you accomplished anything, look deep and think of something you did that helped the company Or better yet, describe an accomplishment that you contributed to the company, just make sure it in the same line of work For example, don't take credit for boosting sales revenue if your job is to fix computers\\u2022 Briefly talk about your current employer\\u2022 Discuss 23 of your most significant accomplishments\\u2022 Talk about a few of your key strengths as they relate to the job for which you are applying and how they can benefit from your strengths\\u2022 Then discuss how you see yourself fitting into a position at their company1 Speak of how you completed projects on time and under budget 2 Tell them how you increased sales revenues for two straight quarters in a row 3 Describe of how you came up with a new procedure that saved the company money4 I have been in the customer service industry for several years and most of my experience has been dealing with calls from our customers I truly enjoy working with the people in this business as well as the challenges In my last job, the good relationships I formed with my customers resulted in me holding the highest customer retention rate of everyone else in my department5 One of my best strengths is my attention to

Interview Coach in America and author of 3 bestselling books http://wwwjobinterviewtoolscomGood interview answer to Tell me about yourselfWatch Don show you exactly how to tell interviewers about yourself with one of the toughest interview questions, tell me about yourselfThis is an openended question, but really what the interviewer wants to hear is about your recent work experience Why don't they just ask that question Because they want to see where you will go with an openended question Your answer tells the interviewer where your mind is If you start telling him that you are a Cleveland Browns fan, then you are way off base with what he wants to hear and you have just made your first mistake What do you want the interviewer to know about you when you leave, your work experience or your personal interests I'm confident their hiring decision will be based on your work experience, save your personal interests for the water cooler after you get the jobWrong answer to tell me about yourself: 1 What would you like to know This statement completely throws the question back at the interviewer in somewhat of an insulting way and he/she is forced to reword the questionBest answer to tell me about yourself:1 What part of my work experience would you like me to talk about a Now the interviewer can reply with a simple straightforward answer Some interviewers want you to start from your first job and others only want to hear about your most recent job b If the interviewer would like you to start from your first job, assuming it has been several years since you had that job, then lightly touch on the jobs that you no longer hold, but expand on your current or most recent job experience and accomplishmentsFocus on your answer and talk about your accomplishments from your current or most recent job and lightly touch on your daily duties These are the things an interviewer really wants to hear Because if he thinks you were successful at your past job, then you will be successful at this job Even if you don't feel that you accomplished anything, look deep and think of something you did that helped the company Or better yet, describe an accomplishment that you contributed to the company, just make sure it in the same line of work For example, don't take credit for boosting sales revenue if your job is to fix computers\\u2022 Briefly talk about your current employer\\u2022 Discuss 23 of your most significant accomplishments\\u2022 Talk about a few of your key strengths as they relate to the job for which you are applying and how they can benefit from your strengths\\u2022 Then discuss how you see yourself fitting into a position at their company1 Speak of how you completed projects on time and under budget 2 Tell them how you increased sales revenues for two straight quarters in a row 3 Describe of how you came up with a new procedure that saved the company money4 I have been in the customer service industry for several years and most of my experience has been dealing with calls from our customers I truly enjoy working with the people in this business as well as the challenges In my last job, the good relationships I formed with my customers resulted in me holding the highest customer retention rate of everyone else in my department5 One of my best strengths is my attention to detail When I set out to work on a task or project, I always make sure it get done on timeVist http://wwwJobInterviewToolscom and snag the latest copy of the Complete Interview Answer Guide It will show you how to answer any type of interview question

baby, don't goSimple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonightIt hard to let it goYou're giving me too many thingsLately you're all I needYou smiled at me and said,Don't get me wrong I love youBut does that mean I have to meet your fatherWhen we are older you'll understandWhat I meant when I said No,I don't think life is quite that simpleWhen you walk awayYou don't hear me say pleaseOh baby, don't goSimple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonightIt hard to let it goThe daily things that keep us all busylike this and that and what is whatAre confusing meThat when you came to me and said,Wish I could prove I love youBut does that mean I have to walk on waterWhen we are older you'll understandIt enough when I say soAnd maybe some things are that simpleWhen you walk awayYou don't hear me say pleaseOh baby, don't goSimple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonightIt hard to let it goHold meWhatever lies beyond this morningIs a little later onRegardless of warnings the future doesn't scare me at allNothing like beforeWhen you walk awayYou don't hear me say pleaseOh baby, don't goSimple and clean is the way that you're making me feel

humming in the restless summer airAnd we're slipping off the course that we preparedBut in all chaos, there is calculationDropping glasses just to hear them breakYou've been drinking like the world was gonna end it didn'tTook a shiner from the fist of your best friend go figureIt clear that someone gotta goWe mean it, but I promise we're not meanAnd the cry goes outThey lose their minds for usAnd how it plays outNow we're in the ringAnd we're coming for bloodYou can try and take usBut we're the gladiatorsEveryone a ragerBut secretly they're saviorsGlory and gore go hand and handThat why we're making headlinesYou can try and take usBut victory contagiousDelicate in every way but one the swordplayGod know we like archaic kinds of fun the old wayChance is the only game I play with, babyWe let our battle choose us[Chorus]No one 'round here good at keeping their eyes closedThe sun starting to light up when we're walking homeTired little laughs, goldlie promisesWe'll always win at thisI don't ever thing about deathIt alright if you do, it fineWe gladiate but I guess we're really fighting ourselvesRoughing up our minds so we're ready when the killtime comesWide awake in bed, words in my brain:Secretly you love this, do you even wanna go freeLet me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means[Chorus] lorde glory and gore 400 lux buzzcut season team royals still sane

Song 1953 Eartha Kitt Santa Baby was originally recorded by Eartha Kitt with Henri Ren\\xe9 and his orchestra in New York City on October 6, 1953 It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 205502 in the USA, and by EMI on the His Master Voice label as catalog number B 10728 The song was a huge hit for Kitt, and she later said that it was one of her favorite songs to record; she reprised it in the 1954 film New Faces Kitt also reprised the original song in a 1963 rerecording for Kapp Records, with a more uptempo arrangement Madonna popular rendition for the 1987 charity album A Very Special Christmas is based on this latter version In 1954, Eartha Kitt recorded a new version of the song with new lyrics titled This Year Santa Baby, to no commercial success Writers listed did not change The song was featured in the 1989 film Driving Miss Daisy santa baby original song 1953 eartha kitt Chris Brown This Christmas Music video by Chris Brown performing This Christmas C

Uploaded & Enjoy My Christmas Everyone Home Alone SoundTrack Run Rudolph Chuck By Christmas Music Py Como It Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas RCA Victor Records 1951 It Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas is a classic Christmas song written in 1951 by Meredith Willson The song was originally titled It Beginning to Look Like Christmas The song has been recorded by many artists, but was a hit by Py Como and The Fontane Sisters with Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra on September 10, 1951 A popular but unproven belief in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, holds that Willson wrote the song while staying in Yarmouth Grand Hotel The song makes reference to a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well; the park being Frost Park, directly across the road from the Grand Hotel which still operates in Yarmouth However Grand Hotel was a popular name used by many hotels in numerous towns and citiesIt beginning to look a lot like Christmas Ev'rywhere you go; Take a look in the fiveandten, glistening once again With candy canes and silver lanes aglow It beginning to look a lot like Christmas, Toys in ev'ry store, But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be On your own front door A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots Is the wish of Barney and Ben; Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk Is the hope of Janice and Jen; And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again It beginning to look a lot like Christmas Ev'rywhere you go; There a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well, The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow It beginning to look a lot like Christmas; Soon the bells will start, And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing Right within your heart Py Como It Beginning To Look Lot Like Christmas the fontaine

i v a t e  e r r Train Ride from London England to Edinburgh Scotland 9152009 in HD I flew to London England in September While there, I took a day trip to Scotland to see the countryside of England and Scotland The countryside of England reminded me of the countryside of Ohio and Michigan It was interesting to people watch, noticing the very subtle difference in facial features as compared with the average American mutt Here in America, we have so many cultures, ethnicities from many European and non european nations as well as the native Americans, who have over the last 2 or 3 hundred years integrated to various degrees in different parts of this country Its rare here that an individual doesn't have 2, 3 or 4 different nationalities In England, I had a great time talking to people at bus and subway stations, coffee houses and even at the grocery store inquiring about their background and a bit of the local history Most of the people there are completely English, scottish or Irish or at least the ones I talked too This footage was taken on my 33rd birthday 9152009 I was surprised though to find graffiti in small cities in England and even Scotland I guess subconsciously i associated graffiti with American cultureSince I only stayed till sunset, I walked all around Edinburgh taking pictures and video and getting lostAs the sun began to lower in the clear Scottish skies, it was time to head back to Waverly stationIt was a beautiful day and after boarding back on the train, a beautiful sunsetOn the way back I spoke the whole time to this English woman named Fionna, who bought be tea and biscuits after I mentioned it was my birthday We talked the whole time and it was nice in that moment to really chat in depth with some one on the other side of the world whom I'd never see again I arrived back in London just after midnight and in light rain with out an umbrella When I stood up to exit the train, I almost fell over because of the sever pain in my feet from walking all over Edinburg from 11:00 am till 7:00 pm The next day back in London, I stayed in to rest my feet Train ride to scotland from London European vacation Bjork I've seen it all imovie canon

AvenueLyricsThere a place off Ocean AvenueWhere I used to sit and talk with youWe were both 16 and it felt so rightSleeping all day, staying up all nightStaying up all nightThere a place on the corner of Chy Street We would walk on the beach in our bare feetWe were both 18 and it felt so rightSleeping all day, staying up all nightStaying up all nightIf I could find you now things would get betterWe could leave this town and run foreverLet your waves crash down on me and take me awayThere a piece of you that here with meIt everywhere I go, it everything I seeWhen I sleep, I dream and it gets me byI can make believe that you're here tonightThat you're here tonightIf I could find you now things would get betterWe could leave this town and run foreverI know somewhere, somehow we'll be togetherLet your waves crash down on me and take me awayI remember the look in your eyesWhen I told you that this was goodbyeYou were begging me not tonightNot here, not nowWe're looking up at the same night skyAnd keep pretending the sun will not rise Be together for one more nightSomewhere, somehowIf I could find you now things would get betterWe could leave this town and run foreverI know somewhere, somehow we'll be togetherLet your waves crash down on me and take me away I tried Fall For You from Secondhand Serenade, but Youtube didnt let me Ocean Avenue Yellowcard L33Rixx Music

to understand and can make fish keeping for beginners easierOnce you know this cycle, it pretty easy to cycle it Just introduce a form of ammonia fish food, a frozen shrimp overnight, a few hardy fish, or PURE ammonia for example and the rest is testing for ammonia, nitrite and nitrate levels Once most chemicals are cleared you can slowly add your fish to the aquariumIf you have any questions,

Nitrogen cycle How to construct a nitrogen cycle diagram nitrogen cycle nitrates ammonia nitrifying denitrifying fixing bacteria lightning legumes NITROGEN CYCLE NITROGEN CYCLE:Nitrogen is the important essential element for all living organisms by the synthesis of Amino acids, proteins, EnzymesetcWhat happens if there is no Nitrogen Root systems and plant growth are stuntedOlder leaves turn yellowDecrease in crop production Soil microorganisms life become dangerousIn Atmosphere its concentration is 78 percentageThe circulation or cyclic movement of Nitrogen from the atmosphere physical or abiotic component to soilBiotic componentand back into the atmosphere is known asNitrogen cycle involves various steps:1Nitrogen fixation 2Nitrogen assimilation 3 Ammonification 4 Nitrification 5 Denitrification Plants cannot utilize Atmospheric nitrogen so it should be converted into utilizable form such as Ammonia1Nitrogenfixation:This is the first step of Nitrogen fixationConversion of atmospheric nitrogen into Ammonia for living organismsis known as Nitrogen fixationThis process is carried out by leguminous plants such as ground nut; even some bacteriacan fix atmospheric nitrogenExamples of bacteria Azotobacter Clostridium, Rhizobium, Nostoc and Anabaena2NitrogenAssimilation:The process of absorbing Nitrates and Ammonia into Organic nitrogen is known as Nitrogen AssimilationThis organic nitrogen is transfed into animal body when plants are eaten by animals 3 Ammonification:The process of converting organic nitrogen into Ammonia when Animals die is known as AmmonificationIt is also known asMineralizationThis process was carried out by some Saprophytes like Fungi andBacteriaAmmonia is also produced from volcanic eruptions and excretory products of Animals4Nitrification:The Bacteria which is involved in nitrification is known as Nitrifying bacteriaAmmonia is first converted to nitritesExamples: Nitrosomonas,NitrococcusNitrites are converted to nitratesExamples:Nitrobacter5Denitrification:Nitrates are converted into molecular nitrogen through Nitric oxide is known as Denitrification, in order to maintain the equilibrium of nitrogen in the atmosphereBacteria which are involved in denitrificationare known as denitrifying bacteriaExamples: Thiobacillusdenitrificans,Pseuodomonasdenitrificans and MicrococcusdenitrificansProblems with increase of Nitrogen:Acid rain formation Acidification of soil and lakes Increase in death of plants7 Active Technology Solutions PvtLtd is an educational 3D digital content provider forK12 We also

http://youtube/yzzU6sGxatMMore Celebrity News \\u25ba\\u25ba http://bitly/SubClevverNewsThe Freak Show has FINALLY arrived, and if the season premiere is any indication, we\\u2019re in for one WILD ride Yes, American Horror Story: Freak Show debuted on FX last night and it was just as creepy \\u2013 if not creepier \\u2013 than you\\u2019d imagine it to beAnd since it was a supersized 90 minute episode, we\\u2019re going to break down five of the downright scariest moments just for you guys And obviously, a recap means there\\u2019s going to be some spoilers, so if you\\u2019ve yet to tune in yet \\u2013 maybe you\\u2019re just waiting to watch it when it\\u2019s light outside, no judgment \\u2013 hit pause and check out this video instead \\u2013 it\\u2019s basically the ultimate preview CLICK THROUGH TO ANOTHER VIDEO BOXAlright, let\\u2019s get startedFirst up, let\\u2019s talk about the conjoined twins Bette and Dot and the fact that, oh ya know, BETTE KILLED THEIR MOTHER Which is totally crazy because we got the vibe that Bette was the sweeter one This just shows, you gotta watch out for the nice ones But yes, Bette kills their mother not only because she basically locked them away for most of their lives, but Bette wants to be a STAR \\u2013 and will get rid of anyone who gets in the way of her dream The second moment that made all the hairs on the back of our neck stand up Our first intro to Twisty the clown Two kids were getting frisky by the lake when ol\\u2019 Twisty showed up to haunt all of our dreams forever It seemed innocent enough at first but then\\u2026We guess they call him a killer clown for a reasonNext, there was a freaking carnie sex tape Yes, Jessica Lange\\u2019s character became friendly with a hospital worker, from where she found Bette and Dot, and brought her along to the freak show And well, things got FREAKY \\u2013 in more ways than one We\\u2019re going to try to keep things PG here, but we think her reaction shot says it allAnd because what AHS episode would be complete without someone dying, the next moment on our list is when Jimmy killed a cop who came looking for Bette and DotThat\\u2019s one way to keep the family togetherAnd last but certainly not least, this moment is really creepy, but it was definitely a highlight Elsa Mars takes the stage to sing David Bowie\\u2019s \\u201cLife on Mars\\u201d and not only did we get to see the freak show in action, the whole thing was just AWESOMEOh, and a bonus highlight We got to see that the woman in charge was a \\u201cfreak\\u201d herself as she had a moment when she revealed that she is missing her legsOh, and a bonus highlight We got to see that the woman in charge was a \\u201cfreak\\u201d herself as she had a moment when she revealed that she

Philharmonic Youth Orchestra and its director, Kayson Brown, approached us with this idea We loved it It combined two of the things we are working to accomplish inviting people to classical music and inspiring young musicians Steven Sharp Nelson had soloed with the orchestra the previous year and loved the spirit and the talent that the orchestra showed at such young ages ages 1318 Together we developed the concept of Beethoven 5 Secrets, combining OneRepublic tune Secrets with melodies and moments from all four movements of Beethoven 5th SymphonyWe used 5 different melodies from the 4 movements of Beethoven 5th Symphony not including the bridge the orchestra plays in the middle Try to guess where they are and where they come fromWhat are Beethoven secrets He had many His most prominent secret that he desperately tried to keep from the public and that caused him to be considered extremely eccentric, irritable, and hermitlike was his weakness He was deaf during most of his life Imagine thatone of the greatest composers that ever lived could hardly hear And yet, he wrote his life greatest works after becoming deaf He believed that art itself had secrets that had to be forced into in order to obtain art highest level There is no doubt Beethoven discovered many of the secrets of art people all over the world enjoy them every day He was a true master of music, blessed by God This piece and video are dedicated to himFilming locations:The Mountains of St George UtahAmerican Heritage SchoolTPG StudiosMetCom Studio Behind the Scenes footageCreditsArrangement written

like each note of the music was a word in a vivid story being told When writing a song sometimes you just need a little spark That catalyst came from a piece of classical music one that had such a storybook feel to it that we gleaned inspiration from it: SaintSa\\xebns' Aquarium from his Suite Carnival of the Animals It an incredibly beautiful and transportive piece You can listen to it here: https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=XCBDlC0N8Rc When we were finished we all stepped back and listened as objectively as we could, imagining what sort of story was being told in order to identify the best places to film What happened surprised us all The story itself took over It was like film score but in reverse more here: http://smarturlit/TPGStoryOfMyLifeCreditsStory of My Life One Direction

advice you've ever gottenJason Silva: I always say that one of the best pieces of advice that I've ever gotten, has been echoed by two great thinkers, my mother Linda Mishkin and Joseph Campbell Joseph Campbell said, Follow your bliss I couldn't agree more with that My mom always said, Just do what you love and don't worry about anything else, don't worry about money, don't worry about anything Just be kind to everyone and do what you loveAs long as you're not hurting anybody else, as long as you're being kind to people and you're doing what you love, only good things can come of it Other good advices are people who claim to have absolute irrefutable faith in something without any evidence, I would not trust completely Yeah, I just, I'm a, I relate a lot to people like Carl Sagan I recently read one of his books that was based on a speech that he gave in a divinity school It interesting because Carl Sagan was one hundred percent a scientist but he was very spiritual I mean and he said, The universe gives up plenty to be spiritual about, we don't need to adapt any form of dogmaLook at the evidence and to be willing to question your own truths, and to be willing to scrutinize things that you hold dearly because that way, that transparency, that self awareness will protect you from ever becoming somebody that whose beliefs somehow make them have myopic vision about what could be So, remain open and be willing to be transformed by new informationRecorded on: April 14, 2009Question: What the best advice you've ever gottenJason Silva: I always say that one of the best

you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goStaring at the bottom of your glassHoping one day you'll make a dream lastBut dreams come slow and they go so fastYou see her when you close your eyesMaybe one day you'll understand whyEverything you touch surely diesBut you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goStaring at the ceiling in the darkSame old empty feeling in your heart'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fastWell you see her when you fall asleepBut never to touch and never to keep'Cause you loved her too muchAnd you dived too deepWell you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goAnd you let her goWell you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when

with you, my heart continues to beatWith every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, strolling so casually,We're different and the sameGet you another nameSwitch up the batteryIf you gave me a chanceI would take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou can't shake meWhen I am with youThere no place I'd rather beNo no no no noNo place I'd rather beWe set out on a mission to find our inner peace Make it everlastingSo nothing incompleteIt easy being with you, sacred simplicityAs long as we're together, there no place I'd rather be With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, strolling so casually,We're different and the sameGet you another nameSwitch up the batteryIf you gave me a chanceI would take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou

you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goStaring at the bottom of your glassHoping one day you'll make a dream lastBut dreams come slow and they go so fastYou see her when you close your eyesMaybe one day you'll understand whyEverything you touch surely diesBut you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goStaring at the ceiling in the darkSame old empty feeling in your heart'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fastWell you see her when you fall asleepBut never to touch and never to keep'Cause you loved her too muchAnd you dived too deepWell you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goAnd you let her goWell you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her go Passenger Ed Sheeran Musical

EhrpunktEditor: Kolja FraseThe Dog: DonAn EASYdoesit ProductionIs club music allowed to be melancholy once in awhile Absolutely, it even has to be At least when the French alternativepopfolk superstars Nili Hadida and Benjamin Cotto, alias Lilly Wood & The Prick, have their way Their haunting melody Prayer in C was quickly snatched up by the DJ, producer and label owner Robin Schulz from Osnabruck, Germany, and sublimated into a shining dancefloor pearlAt the beginning of this year the head of Lausbuben Records Rascal Records and star DJ Robin Schulz already entered the Top 40 of the German iTunes charts with his single Sunset Last March he shoved none less than Pharrell Williams from the charts throne with his Waves remix for the Dutch rapper Mr Probz and took a cosy position at Number One in the German singles, iTunes, airplay and dance hitparade charts But this is not all because Robin Schulz is more than successful on an international level The Waves remix stayed at #24 in the global iTunes Single Charts, at #21 in the global Spotify Charts and has held a Top 10 position in the Beatport Charts for more than three months Following acclaimed live appearances in Germany, Holland, France and the UK, the Soundcloudplays millionaire reached into his electronic bag of tricks and delivers a preview for the upcoming summer holidays with his deep house style remix of Lilly Wood & The Prick Prayer in CIt a superstar collaboration: Prayer in C is the acoustic counterpart to an open air summer party night in the Provence: the scent of lavender in the air and an atmosphere somewhere between melancholy and euphoria The track is driven by the absolutely captivating, goosebumpinducing voice of Nili Hadidas, who with her sexysmoky timbre, the haunting lyrics as well as Benjamin Cotto wistful acoustic guitar melody create the organic vibe The Robin Schulz remix underlays the track with a tight straighton beat that transforms the original folkpop track into an energic melodyhouse club hymn And Schulz must know how to do it: nearly 113,000 Soundcloud followers, who clicked his tracks several million times altogether, can't be wrong for example, Willst Du has more than 12 million clicks or Sunset more than 820,000 And also his YouTube videos for his bootlegs with millions of clicks show that Robin Schulz knows how to seize the latest sound and serve it up to the masses in a sizzling new package At the moment Robin Schulz is experiencing the hottest clubs in Europe on an extending tour And the original creators of the track, the Paris duo Lilly Wood & The Prick don't have to play themselves down as far as fame is concerned At home in France, the duo advanced to genuine superstars following their doubleplatinum debut abum At the beginning of the year, one album track, Into Trouble was used in a TV spot for the noble jewelry brand Cartier Together with Robin Schulz they deliver the next club diamond with Prayer in C Robin Schulz Remix Berlin electro

videoLyrics:We're a thousand miles from comfort, we have travelled land and sea,But as long as you are with me, there no place I'd rather beI would wait forever, exalted in the scene,As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beatWith every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, strolling so casually,We're different and the sameGet you another nameSwitch up the batteryIf you gave me a chanceI would take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou can't shake meWhen I am with youThere no place I'd rather beNo no no no noNo place I'd rather beWe set out on a mission to find our inner peace Make it everlastingSo nothing incompleteIt easy being with you, sacred simplicityAs long as we're together, there no place I'd rather be With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, strolling so casually,We're different and the sameGet you another nameSwitch up the batteryIf you gave me a chanceI would take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou can't shake meWhen I am with youThere no place I'd rather beNo no no no noNo place I'd rather beWhen I am with youThere no place I'd rather be cleanbandit clean bandit official official video remix

you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goStaring at the bottom of your glassHoping one day you'll make a dream lastBut dreams come slow and they go so fastYou see her when you close your eyesMaybe one day you'll understand whyEverything you touch surely diesBut you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goStaring at the ceiling in the darkSame old empty feeling in your heart'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fastWell you see her when you fall asleepBut never to touch and never to keep'Cause you loved her too muchAnd you dived too deepWell you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goAnd you let her goWell you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her go Passenger Ed Sheeran Musical

with you, my heart continues to beatWith every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, strolling so casually,We're different and the sameGet you another nameSwitch up the batteryIf you gave me a chanceI would take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou can't shake meWhen I am with youThere no place I'd rather beNo no no no noNo place I'd rather beWe set out on a mission to find our inner peace Make it everlastingSo nothing incompleteIt easy being with you, sacred simplicityAs long as we're together, there no place I'd rather be With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, strolling so casually,We're different and the sameGet you another nameSwitch up the batteryIf you gave me a chanceI would take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou can't shake meWhen I am with youThere no place I'd rather beNo no no no noNo place I'd rather beWhen I am with youThere no place I'd rather be cleanbandit clean bandit official official video remix

you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goStaring at the bottom of your glassHoping one day you'll make a dream lastBut dreams come slow and they go so fastYou see her when you close your eyesMaybe one day you'll understand whyEverything you touch surely diesBut you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goStaring at the ceiling in the darkSame old empty feeling in your heart'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fastWell you see her when you fall asleepBut never to touch and never to keep'Cause you loved her too muchAnd you dived too deepWell you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goAnd you let her goWell you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her go Passenger Ed Sheeran Musical

roadside,just relax, just relaxDon't you let those other boys fool you,Got to love that afro hair doMaybe sometimes, we feel afraid, but it alrightThe more you stay the same, the more they seem to changeDon't you think it strange[Chorus]Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite songYou go ahead, let your hair downSapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,Just go ahead, let

hear is about your recent work experience Why don't they just ask that question Because they want to see where you will go with an openended question Your answer tells the interviewer where your mind is If you start telling him that you are a Cleveland Browns fan, then you are way off base with what he wants to hear and you have just made your first mistake What do you want the interviewer to know

thinks you were successful at your past job, then you will be successful at this job Even if you don't feel that you accomplished anything, look deep and think of something you did that helped the company Or better yet, describe an accomplishment that you contributed to the company, just make sure it in the same line of work For example, don't take credit for boosting sales revenue if your job is to fix computers\\u2022 Briefly talk about your current employer\\u2022 Discuss 23 of your most significant accomplishments\\u2022 Talk about a few of your key strengths as they relate to the job

baby, don't goSimple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonightIt hard to let it goYou're giving me too many thingsLately you're all I needYou smiled at me and said,Don't get me wrong I love youBut does that mean I have to meet your fatherWhen we are older you'll understandWhat I meant when I said No,I don't think life is quite that simpleWhen you walk awayYou don't hear me say pleaseOh baby, don't goSimple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonightIt hard to let it goThe daily things that keep us all busylike this and that and what is whatAre confusing meThat when you came to me and said,Wish I could prove I love youBut does that mean I have to walk on waterWhen we are older you'll understandIt enough when I say soAnd maybe some things are that simpleWhen you walk awayYou don't hear me say pleaseOh baby, don't goSimple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonightIt hard to let it goHold meWhatever lies beyond this morningIs a little later onRegardless of warnings the future doesn't scare me at allNothing like beforeWhen you walk awayYou don't hear me say pleaseOh baby, don't goSimple and clean is the way that you're making me feel

humming in the restless summer airAnd we're slipping off the course that we preparedBut in all chaos, there is calculationDropping glasses just to hear them breakYou've been drinking like the world was gonna end it didn'tTook a shiner from the fist of your best friend go figureIt clear that someone gotta goWe mean it, but I promise we're not meanAnd the cry goes outThey lose their minds for usAnd how it plays outNow we're in the ringAnd we're coming for bloodYou can try and take usBut we're the gladiatorsEveryone a ragerBut secretly they're saviorsGlory and gore go hand and handThat why we're making headlinesYou can try and take usBut victory contagiousDelicate in every way but one the swordplayGod know we like archaic kinds of fun the old wayChance is the only game I play with, babyWe let our battle choose us[Chorus]No one 'round here good at keeping their eyes closedThe sun starting to light up when we're walking homeTired little laughs, goldlie promisesWe'll always win at thisI don't ever thing about deathIt alright if you do, it fineWe gladiate but I guess we're really fighting ourselvesRoughing up our minds so we're ready when the killtime comesWide awake in bed, words in my brain:Secretly you love this, do you even wanna go freeLet me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means[Chorus] lorde glory and gore 400 lux buzzcut season team royals still sane

Eartha Kitt Santa Baby was originally recorded by Eartha Kitt with Henri Ren\\xe9 and his orchestra in New York City on October 6, 1953 It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 205502 in the USA, and by EMI on the His Master Voice label as catalog number B 10728 The song was a huge hit for Kitt, and she later said that it was one of her favorite songs to record; she reprised it in the 1954 film New Faces Kitt also reprised the original song in a 1963 rerecording for Kapp Records, with a more uptempo arrangement Madonna popular rendition for the 1987 charity album A Very Special Christmas is based on this latter version In 1954, Eartha Kitt recorded a new version of the song with new lyrics titled This Year Santa Baby, to no commercial success Writers listed did not change The song was featured in the 1989 film Driving Miss Daisy santa baby original song 1953 eartha kitt Chris Brown This Christmas Music video by Chris Brown performing This Christmas C 2007 Zomba

Christmas is a classic Christmas song written in 1951 by Meredith Willson The song was originally titled It Beginning to Look Like Christmas The song has been recorded by many artists, but was a hit by Py Como and The Fontane Sisters with Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra on September 10, 1951 A popular but unproven belief in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, holds that Willson wrote the song while staying in Yarmouth Grand Hotel The song makes reference to a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well; the park being Frost Park, directly across the road from the Grand Hotel which still operates in Yarmouth However Grand Hotel was a popular name used by many hotels in numerous towns and citiesIt beginning to look a lot like Christmas Ev'rywhere you go; Take a look in the fiveandten, glistening once again With candy canes and silver lanes aglow It beginning to look a lot like Christmas, Toys in ev'ry store, But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be On your own front door A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots Is the wish of Barney and Ben; Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk Is the hope of Janice and Jen; And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again It beginning to look a lot like Christmas Ev'rywhere you go; There a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well, The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow It beginning to look a lot like Christmas; Soon the bells will start, And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing Right within your heart Py Como It Beginning To Look Lot Like Christmas the fontaine

i v a t e  e r r Train Ride from London England to Edinburgh Scotland 9152009 in HD I flew to London England in September While there, I took a day trip to Scotland to see the countryside of England and Scotland The countryside of England reminded me of the countryside of Ohio and Michigan It was interesting to people watch, noticing the very subtle difference in facial features as compared with the average American mutt Here in America, we have so many cultures, ethnicities from many European and non european nations as well as the native Americans, who have over the last 2 or 3 hundred years integrated to various degrees in different parts of this country Its rare here that an individual doesn't have 2, 3 or 4 different nationalities In England, I had a great time talking to people at bus and subway stations, coffee houses and even at the grocery store inquiring about their background and a bit of the local history Most of the people there are completely English, scottish or Irish or at least the ones I talked too This footage was taken on my 33rd birthday 9152009 I was surprised though to find graffiti in small cities in England and even Scotland I guess subconsciously i associated graffiti with American cultureSince I only stayed till sunset, I walked all around Edinburgh taking pictures and video and getting lostAs the sun began to lower in the clear Scottish skies, it was time to head back to Waverly stationIt was a beautiful day and after boarding back on the train, a beautiful sunsetOn the way back I spoke the whole time to this English woman named Fionna, who bought be tea and biscuits after I mentioned it was my birthday We talked the whole time and it was nice in that moment to really chat in depth with some one on the other side of the world whom I'd never see again I arrived back in London just after midnight and in light rain with out an umbrella When I stood up to exit the train, I almost fell over because of the sever pain in my feet from walking all over Edinburg from 11:00 am till 7:00 pm The next day back in London, I stayed in to rest my feet Train ride to scotland from London European vacation Bjork I've seen it all imovie canon

AvenueLyricsThere a place off Ocean AvenueWhere I used to sit and talk with youWe were both 16 and it felt so rightSleeping all day, staying up all nightStaying up all nightThere a place on the corner of Chy Street We would walk on the beach in our bare feetWe were both 18 and it felt so rightSleeping all day, staying up all nightStaying up all nightIf I could find you now things would get betterWe could leave this town and run foreverLet your waves crash down on me and take me awayThere a piece of you that here with meIt everywhere I go, it everything I seeWhen I sleep, I dream and it gets me byI can make believe that you're here tonightThat you're here tonightIf I could find you now things would get betterWe could leave this town and run foreverI know somewhere, somehow we'll be togetherLet your waves crash down on me and take me awayI remember the look in your eyesWhen I told you that this was goodbyeYou were begging me not tonightNot here, not nowWe're looking up at the same night skyAnd keep pretending the sun will not rise Be together for one more nightSomewhere, somehowIf I could find you now things would get betterWe could leave this town and run foreverI know somewhere, somehow we'll be togetherLet your waves crash down on me and take me away I tried Fall For You from Secondhand Serenade, but Youtube didnt let me Ocean Avenue Yellowcard L33Rixx Music

Nitrogen cycle How to construct a nitrogen cycle diagram nitrogen cycle nitrates ammonia nitrifying denitrifying fixing bacteria lightning legumes NITROGEN CYCLE NITROGEN CYCLE:Nitrogen is the important essential element for all living organisms by the synthesis of Amino acids, proteins, EnzymesetcWhat happens if there is no Nitrogen Root systems and plant growth are stuntedOlder leaves turn yellowDecrease in crop production Soil microorganisms life become dangerousIn Atmosphere its concentration is 78 percentageThe circulation or cyclic movement of Nitrogen from the atmosphere physical or abiotic component to soilBiotic componentand back into the atmosphere is known asNitrogen cycle involves various steps:1Nitrogen fixation 2Nitrogen assimilation 3 Ammonification 4 Nitrification 5 Denitrification Plants cannot utilize Atmospheric nitrogen so it should be converted into utilizable form such as Ammonia1Nitrogenfixation:This is the first step of Nitrogen fixationConversion of atmospheric nitrogen into Ammonia for living organismsis known as Nitrogen fixationThis process is carried out by leguminous plants such as ground nut; even some bacteriacan fix atmospheric nitrogenExamples of bacteria Azotobacter Clostridium, Rhizobium, Nostoc and Anabaena2NitrogenAssimilation:The process of absorbing Nitrates and Ammonia into Organic nitrogen is known as Nitrogen AssimilationThis organic nitrogen is transfed into animal body when plants are eaten by animals 3 Ammonification:The process of converting organic nitrogen into Ammonia when Animals die is known as AmmonificationIt is also known asMineralizationThis process was carried out by some Saprophytes like Fungi andBacteriaAmmonia is also produced from volcanic eruptions and excretory products of Animals4Nitrification:The Bacteria which is involved in nitrification is known as Nitrifying bacteriaAmmonia is first converted to nitritesExamples: Nitrosomonas,NitrococcusNitrites are converted to nitratesExamples:Nitrobacter5Denitrification:Nitrates are converted into molecular nitrogen through Nitric oxide is known as Denitrification, in order to maintain the equilibrium of nitrogen in the atmosphereBacteria which are involved in denitrificationare known as denitrifying bacteriaExamples: Thiobacillusdenitrificans,Pseuodomonasdenitrificans and MicrococcusdenitrificansProblems with increase of Nitrogen:Acid rain formation Acidification of soil and lakes Increase in death of plants7 Active Technology Solutions PvtLtd is an educational 3D digital content provider forK12 We also

http://youtube/yzzU6sGxatMMore Celebrity News \\u25ba\\u25ba http://bitly/SubClevverNewsThe Freak Show has FINALLY arrived, and if the season premiere is any indication, we\\u2019re in for one WILD ride Yes, American Horror Story: Freak Show debuted on FX last night and it was just as creepy \\u2013 if not creepier \\u2013 than you\\u2019d imagine it to beAnd since it was a supersized 90 minute episode, we\\u2019re going to break down five of the downright scariest moments just for you guys And obviously, a recap means there\\u2019s going to be some spoilers, so if you\\u2019ve yet to tune in yet \\u2013 maybe you\\u2019re just waiting to watch it when it\\u2019s light outside, no judgment \\u2013 hit pause and check out this video instead \\u2013 it\\u2019s basically the ultimate preview CLICK THROUGH TO ANOTHER VIDEO BOXAlright, let\\u2019s get startedFirst up, let\\u2019s talk about the conjoined twins Bette and Dot and the fact that, oh ya know, BETTE KILLED THEIR MOTHER Which is totally crazy because we got the vibe that Bette was the sweeter one This just shows, you gotta watch out for the nice ones But yes, Bette kills their mother not only because she basically locked them away for most of their lives, but Bette wants to be a STAR \\u2013 and will get rid of anyone who gets in the way of her dream The second moment that made all the hairs on the back of our neck stand up Our first intro to Twisty the clown Two kids were getting frisky by the lake when ol\\u2019 Twisty showed up to haunt all of our dreams forever It seemed innocent enough at first but then\\u2026We guess they call him a killer clown for a reasonNext, there was a freaking carnie sex tape Yes, Jessica Lange\\u2019s character became friendly with a hospital worker, from where she found Bette and Dot, and brought her along to the freak show And well, things got FREAKY \\u2013 in more ways than one We\\u2019re going to try to keep things PG here, but we think her reaction shot says it allAnd because what AHS episode would be complete without someone dying, the next moment on our list is when Jimmy killed a cop who came looking for Bette and DotThat\\u2019s one way to keep the family togetherAnd last but certainly not least, this moment is really creepy, but it was definitely a highlight Elsa Mars takes the stage to sing David Bowie\\u2019s \\u201cLife on Mars\\u201d and not only did we get to see the freak show in action, the whole thing was just AWESOMEOh, and a bonus highlight We got to see that the woman in charge was a \\u201cfreak\\u201d herself as she had a moment when she revealed that she is missing her legsOh, and a bonus highlight We got to see that the woman in charge was a \\u201cfreak\\u201d herself as she had a moment when she revealed that she

Philharmonic Youth Orchestra and its director, Kayson Brown, approached us with this idea We loved it It combined two of the things we are working to accomplish inviting people to classical music and inspiring young musicians Steven Sharp Nelson had soloed with the orchestra the previous year and loved the spirit and the talent that the orchestra showed at such young ages ages 1318 Together we developed the concept of Beethoven 5 Secrets, combining OneRepublic tune Secrets with melodies and moments from all four movements of Beethoven 5th SymphonyWe used 5 different melodies from the 4 movements of Beethoven 5th Symphony not including the bridge the orchestra plays in the middle Try to guess where they are and where they come fromWhat are Beethoven secrets He had many His most prominent secret that he desperately tried to keep from the public and that caused him to be considered extremely eccentric, irritable, and hermitlike was his weakness He was deaf during most of his life Imagine thatone of the greatest composers that ever lived could hardly hear And yet, he wrote his life greatest works after becoming deaf He believed that art itself had secrets that had to be forced into in order to obtain art highest level There is no doubt Beethoven discovered many of the secrets of art people all over the world enjoy them every day He was a true master of music, blessed by God This piece and video are dedicated to himFilming locations:The Mountains of St George UtahAmerican Heritage SchoolTPG StudiosMetCom Studio Behind the Scenes footageCreditsArrangement written

like each note of the music was a word in a vivid story being told When writing a song sometimes you just need a little spark That catalyst came from a piece of classical music one that had such a storybook feel to it that we gleaned inspiration from it: SaintSa\\xebns' Aquarium from his Suite Carnival of the Animals It an incredibly beautiful and transportive piece You can listen to it here: https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=XCBDlC0N8Rc When we were finished we all stepped back and listened as objectively as we could, imagining what sort of story was being told in order to identify the best places to film What happened surprised us all The story itself took over It was like film score but in reverse more here: http://smarturlit/TPGStoryOfMyLifeCreditsStory of My Life One Direction

advice you've ever gottenJason Silva: I always say that one of the best pieces of advice that I've ever gotten, has been echoed by two great thinkers, my mother Linda Mishkin and Joseph Campbell Joseph Campbell said, Follow your bliss I couldn't agree more with that My mom always said, Just do what you love and don't worry about anything else, don't worry about money, don't worry about anything Just be kind to everyone and do what you loveAs long as you're not hurting anybody else, as long as you're being kind to people and you're doing what you love, only good things can come of it Other good advices are people who claim to have absolute irrefutable faith in something without any evidence, I would not trust completely Yeah, I just, I'm a, I relate a lot to people like Carl Sagan I recently read one of his books that was based on a speech that he gave in a divinity school It interesting because Carl Sagan was one hundred percent a scientist but he was very spiritual I mean and he said, The universe gives up plenty to be spiritual about, we don't need to adapt any form of dogmaLook at the evidence and to be willing to question your own truths, and to be willing to scrutinize things that you hold dearly because that way, that transparency, that self awareness will protect you from ever becoming somebody that whose beliefs somehow make them have myopic vision about what could be So, remain open and be willing to be transformed by new informationRecorded on: April 14, 2009Question: What the best advice you've ever gottenJason Silva: I always say that one of the best

take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou can't shake meWhen I am with youThere no place I'd rather beNo no no no noNo place I'd rather beWe set out on a mission to find our inner peace Make it everlastingSo nothing incompleteIt easy being with you, sacred simplicityAs long as we're together, there no place I'd rather be With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, strolling so casually,We're different and the sameGet you another nameSwitch up the batteryIf you gave me a chanceI would take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou

you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goStaring at the bottom of your glassHoping one day you'll make a dream lastBut dreams come slow and they go so fastYou see her when you close your eyesMaybe one day you'll understand whyEverything you touch surely diesBut you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goStaring at the ceiling in the darkSame old empty feeling in your heart'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fastWell you see her when you fall asleepBut never to touch and never to keep'Cause you loved her too muchAnd you dived too deepWell you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goAnd you let her goWell you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her go Passenger Ed Sheeran Musical

with you, my heart continues to beatWith every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, strolling so casually,We're different and the sameGet you another nameSwitch up the batteryIf you gave me a chanceI would take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou can't shake meWhen I am with youThere no place I'd rather beNo no no no noNo place I'd rather beWe set out on a mission to find our inner peace Make it everlastingSo nothing incompleteIt easy being with you, sacred simplicityAs long as we're together, there no place I'd rather be With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, strolling so casually,We're different and the sameGet you another nameSwitch up the batteryIf you gave me a chanceI would take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou

you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goStaring at the bottom of your glassHoping one day you'll make a dream lastBut dreams come slow and they go so fastYou see her when you close your eyesMaybe one day you'll understand whyEverything you touch surely diesBut you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goStaring at the ceiling in the darkSame old empty feeling in your heart'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fastWell you see her when you fall asleepBut never to touch and never to keep'Cause you loved her too muchAnd you dived too deepWell you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goAnd you let her goWell you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her go Passenger Ed Sheeran Musical

Osnabruck, Germany, and sublimated into a shining dancefloor pearlAt the beginning of this year the head of Lausbuben Records Rascal Records and star DJ Robin Schulz already entered the Top 40 of the German iTunes charts with his single Sunset Last March he shoved none less than Pharrell Williams from the charts throne with his Waves remix for the Dutch rapper Mr Probz and took a cosy position at Number One in the German singles, iTunes, airplay and dance hitparade charts But this is not all because Robin Schulz is more than successful on an international level The Waves remix stayed at #24 in the global iTunes Single Charts, at #21 in the global Spotify Charts and has held a Top 10 position in the Beatport Charts for more than three months Following acclaimed live appearances in Germany, Holland, France and the UK, the Soundcloudplays millionaire reached into his electronic bag of tricks and delivers a preview for the upcoming summer holidays with his deep house style remix of Lilly Wood & The Prick Prayer in CIt a superstar collaboration: Prayer in C is the acoustic counterpart to an open air summer party night in the Provence: the scent of lavender in the air and an atmosphere somewhere between melancholy and euphoria The track is driven by the absolutely captivating, goosebumpinducing voice of Nili Hadidas, who with her sexysmoky timbre, the haunting lyrics as well as Benjamin Cotto wistful acoustic guitar melody create the organic vibe The Robin Schulz remix underlays the track with a tight straighton beat that transforms the original folkpop track into an energic melodyhouse club hymn And Schulz must know how to do it: nearly 113,000 Soundcloud followers, who clicked his tracks several million times altogether, can't be wrong for example, Willst Du has more than 12 million clicks or Sunset more than 820,000 And also his YouTube videos for his bootlegs with millions of clicks show that Robin Schulz knows how to seize the latest sound and serve it up to the masses in a sizzling new package At the moment Robin Schulz is experiencing the hottest clubs in Europe on an extending tour And the original creators of the track, the Paris duo Lilly Wood & The Prick don't have to play themselves down as far as fame is concerned At home in France, the duo advanced to genuine superstars following their doubleplatinum debut abum At the beginning of the year, one album track, Into Trouble was used in a TV spot for the noble jewelry brand Cartier Together with Robin Schulz they deliver the next club diamond with Prayer in C Robin Schulz Remix Berlin electro

videoLyrics:We're a thousand miles from comfort, we have travelled land and sea,But as long as you are with me, there no place I'd rather beI would wait forever, exalted in the scene,As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beatWith every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, strolling so casually,We're different and the sameGet you another nameSwitch up the batteryIf you gave me a chanceI would take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou can't shake meWhen I am with youThere no place I'd rather beNo no no no noNo place I'd rather beWe set out on a mission to find our inner peace Make it everlastingSo nothing incompleteIt easy being with you, sacred simplicityAs long as we're together, there no place I'd rather be With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, strolling so casually,We're different and the sameGet you another nameSwitch up the batteryIf you gave me a chanceI would take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou can't shake meWhen I am with youThere no place I'd rather beNo no no no noNo place I'd rather beWhen I am with youThere no place I'd rather be cleanbandit clean bandit official official video remix

you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goStaring at the bottom of your glassHoping one day you'll make a dream lastBut dreams come slow and they go so fastYou see her when you close your eyesMaybe one day you'll understand whyEverything you touch surely diesBut you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goStaring at the ceiling in the darkSame old empty feeling in your heart'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fastWell you see her when you fall asleepBut never to touch and never to keep'Cause you loved her too muchAnd you dived too deepWell you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goAnd you let her goWell you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her go Passenger Ed Sheeran Musical

videoLyrics:We're a thousand miles from comfort, we have travelled land and sea,But as long as you are with me, there no place I'd rather beI would wait forever, exalted in the scene,As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beatWith every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, strolling so casually,We're different and the sameGet you another nameSwitch up the batteryIf you gave me a chanceI would take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou can't shake meWhen I am with youThere no place I'd rather beNo no no no noNo place I'd rather beWe set out on a mission to find our inner peace Make it everlastingSo nothing incompleteIt easy being with you, sacred simplicityAs long as we're together, there no place I'd rather be With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, strolling so casually,We're different and the sameGet you another nameSwitch up the batteryIf you gave me a chanceI would take itIt a shot in the darkBut I'll make itKnow with all of your heartYou can't shake meWhen I am with youThere no place I'd rather beNo no no no noNo place I'd rather beWhen I am with youThere no place I'd rather be cleanbandit clean bandit official official video remix

you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goStaring at the bottom of your glassHoping one day you'll make a dream lastBut dreams come slow and they go so fastYou see her when you close your eyesMaybe one day you'll understand whyEverything you touch surely diesBut you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goStaring at the ceiling in the darkSame old empty feeling in your heart'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fastWell you see her when you fall asleepBut never to touch and never to keep'Cause you loved her too muchAnd you dived too deepWell you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her goAnd you let her goWell you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her go'Cause you only need the light when it burning lowOnly miss the sun when it starts to snowOnly know you love her when you let her goOnly know you've been high when you're feeling lowOnly hate the road when you're missin' homeOnly know you love her when you let her goAnd you let her go Passenger Ed Sheeran Musical

roadside,just relax, just relaxDon't you let those other boys fool you,Got to love that afro hair doMaybe sometimes, we feel afraid, but it alrightThe more you stay the same, the more they seem to changeDon't you think it strange[Chorus]Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite songYou go ahead, let your hair downSapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,Just go ahead, let your hair downYou're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow'[Verse 3]Twas more than I could take, pity for pity sakeSome nights kept me awake, I thought that I was strongerWhen you gonna realise, that

thinks you were successful at your past job, then you will be successful at this job Even if you don't feel that you accomplished anything, look deep and think of something you did that helped the company Or better yet, describe an accomplishment that you contributed to the company, just make sure it in the same line of work For example, don't take credit for boosting sales revenue if your job is to fix computers\\u2022 Briefly talk about your current employer\\u2022 Discuss 23 of your most significant accomplishments\\u2022 Talk about a few of your key strengths as they relate to the job

baby, don't goSimple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonightIt hard to let it goYou're giving me too many thingsLately you're all I needYou smiled at me and said,Don't get me wrong I love youBut does that mean I have to meet your fatherWhen we are older you'll understandWhat I meant when I said No,I don't think life is quite that simpleWhen you walk awayYou don't hear me say pleaseOh baby, don't goSimple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonightIt hard to let it goThe daily things that keep us all busylike this and that and what is whatAre confusing meThat when you came to me and said,Wish I could prove I love youBut does that mean I have to walk on waterWhen we are older you'll understandIt enough when I say soAnd maybe some things are that simpleWhen you walk awayYou don't hear me say pleaseOh baby, don't goSimple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonightIt hard to let it goHold meWhatever lies beyond this morningIs a little later onRegardless of warnings the future doesn't scare me at allNothing like beforeWhen you walk awayYou don't hear me say pleaseOh baby, don't goSimple and clean is the way that you're making me feel

humming in the restless summer airAnd we're slipping off the course that we preparedBut in all chaos, there is calculationDropping glasses just to hear them breakYou've been drinking like the world was gonna end it didn'tTook a shiner from the fist of your best friend go figureIt clear that someone gotta goWe mean it, but I promise we're not meanAnd the cry goes outThey lose their minds for usAnd how it plays outNow we're in the ringAnd we're coming for bloodYou can try and take usBut we're the gladiatorsEveryone a ragerBut secretly they're saviorsGlory and gore go hand and handThat why we're making headlinesYou can try and take usBut victory contagiousDelicate in every way but one the swordplayGod know we like archaic kinds of fun the old wayChance is the only game I play with, babyWe let our battle choose us[Chorus]No one 'round here good at keeping their eyes closedThe sun starting to light up when we're walking homeTired little laughs, goldlie promisesWe'll always win at thisI don't ever thing about deathIt alright if you do, it fineWe gladiate but I guess we're really fighting ourselvesRoughing up our minds so we're ready when the killtime comesWide awake in bed, words in my brain:Secretly you love this, do you even wanna go freeLet me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means[Chorus] lorde glory and gore 400 lux buzzcut season team royals still sane
